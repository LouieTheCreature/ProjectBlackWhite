An employee of a nearby restaurant, Eric Walsh, said that gunshots were heard around half an hour before midnight. He described how tons of people came into their restaurant with blood on their bodies, and how he was handing napkins to people to wipe the blood off, showing how gory the situation was. </p>\n<blockquote>\"People were coming off the street with blood splatters on white sneakers and skinned knees and skinned elbows... we literally just were balling up napkins and wetting them and handing them to people... it was chaos.\" -Eric Walsh, O'Neals Pub Employee. </blockquote>\n<p>There were hundreds of people on the busy street during the incident. No arrests have been made yet, but police say that two handguns and an extended magazine were found. The first suspect being tracked down is a woman in a 2018 Volkswagen Atlas (again, there are multiple suspects). Not much data has been released on the victims at the time of this article. </p>\n<p>There had been nine other separate shootings from the night before this shooting just in Philadelphia, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/philadelphia-shooting-dead\">according to Philadelphia police. </a></p>\n",

            "content": "\n<img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/06/im-517962.jpg\" alt=\"Researcher's At MIT and Brigham have developed a GEL replacement for pills.\"><p>For a large number of children and some adults, swallowing pills or tablets can be difficult. This problem has been plaguing humankind for decades but researchers at MIT, Brigham, and The Women’s Hospital have created a GEL replacement that's much easier to swallow and can be used to administer a variety of different drugs.</p>\n<p>MIT states that the gels are made from plant-based oils such as sesame oil and can be prepared with a variety of textures from a thickened beverage like a smoothie or a yogurt-like substance. These different textures allow for patients like stroke victims to take the drugs that they need in a much easier way. </p>\n<blockquote>“This platform will change our capacity for what we can do for kids, and also for adults who have difficulty receiving medication. Given the simplicity of the system and its low cost, it could have a tremendous impact on making it easier for patients to take medications,” - MIT, Brigham, and Woman's hospital.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n",
