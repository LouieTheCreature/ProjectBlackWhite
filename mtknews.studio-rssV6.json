It is the world's largest filled-aperture telescope, with it having a diameter of 500 meters. The telescope is located in Southwest China and focuses on discovering new planets and alien species.</p>\n<p>A researcher at the National Astronomical Observatory, Peng Bo, said that the source of the signals are unidentifiable, but the signals are \"likely from alien civilizations\". Other researchers said that it's probable that the signals are just human interference. These signals contain narrow-band signals. Dan Werthimer, an SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) researcher from UC Berkley, stated that he believes that the signals are actually just radio signals from here on Earth in an interview.</p>\n",

We do not have a clear ship date or price yet, but a leak recently said that it might ship on July 21st for around $620. This indicates that it will be a mid-ranger.

However, it doesn't seem as extreme as how the internals of the Nothing Ear 1 were displayed. It appears that the device will have a dual-camera setup, but the actual camera specs are unknown. The phone is expected to feature a Snapdragon 7 Series chip. One leak suggests that the phone will be capable of 45W fast charging, but the battery capacity itself is unclear. And yes, it will have wireless charging capabilities. The CEO of Nothing, Carl Pei, has promised that the phone will receive four years of software updates. He has also said that NothingOS will feature seamless integration with its own and third-party products, which seems like a tough promise to make. Speaking of the OS, it is expected to have minimal animations, and graphical elements unique to Nothing. The sound design is also supposed to be unique, having &quot;raw&quot; sounds and imitating things like &quot;morse code, oscillators, and digital watches&quot;. NothingOS will be based on Google's Android.</p>\n",

The suspect was also shot in the arm, but sources say that it is not clear whether it was from the officer's shooting or not. An employee of a nearby restaurant, Eric Walsh, said that gunshots were heard around half an hour before midnight. He described how tons of people came into their restaurant with blood on their bodies, and how he was handing napkins to people to wipe the blood off, showing how gory the situation was. </p>\n<blockquote>\"People were coming off the street with blood splatters on white sneakers and skinned knees and skinned elbows... we literally just were balling up napkins and wetting them and handing them to people... it was chaos.\" -Eric Walsh, O'Neals Pub Employee. </blockquote>\n<p>There were hundreds of people on the busy street during the incident. No arrests have been made yet, but police say that two handguns and an extended magazine were found. The first suspect being tracked down is a woman in a 2018 Volkswagen Atlas (again, there are multiple suspects). Not much data has been released on the victims at the time of this article. </p>\n<p>There had been nine other separate shootings from the night before this shooting just in Philadelphia, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/philadelphia-shooting-dead\">according to Philadelphia police. </a></p>\n",

Cruise will be the first company to operate a commercial autonomous taxi service in a major US city, the COO of Cruise, Gil West, stated.

The service will be active from 10 PM to 6 AM every day, and when weather conditions are fit for use. </p>\n<p>In April, General Motors noted that it will spend $2 billion this year on Cruise. The company has not made a profit yet but is expected to once the service is operational. Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said that he aims to reach $50 billion in revenue over the next eight years. GM is reportedly developing a car called the Origin in a partnership with Honda, which Cruise plans to use in the future. The car will have no steering wheel or gas pedal. Production for this vehicle is expected to begin in early 2023 at Factory Zero, Detriot. </p>\n<p>Elon Musk had previously promised that Tesla would be operating a robotic taxi division by 2020, which was later failed to meet. </p>\n",

But SpaceX says that they are currently still too big to take off.</p>\n<p>SpaceX says that Gen2 satellites are 22 feet long and weigh 2,755 pounds. When compared to the first generation, which only weighed 573 pounds, that is considerably smaller.</p>\n<blockquote> \"A lot of people talk a lot about how many launches per year there are to orbit, but this is not really what matters. I think what really matters is what's the total useful payload to orbit per year, Cause otherwise you could say if this were ocean ships, you'd be like comparing a dinghy to a supertanker.\" - Elon Musk</blockquote>\n<p>For SpaceX to even consider getting the satellite into space at the current weight, they would have to prepare a Starship Heavy-lift rocket, and that's no small rocket. </p>\n",

Today marks the first day of the 2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season, running from June 1st to November 30th. <a href=\"http://mtknews.studio/noaa.gov\">NOAA</a> predicts between 14 and 21 named storms to form this season, with 6-10 becoming hurricanes, and 3-6 becoming major hurricanes (Category 3 - Category 5). </p>\n<p>Invest 91L has a 70% chance of formation in the next 48 hours, and an 80% chance of formation in the next 5 days, according to the NHC. It is expected to move northeastward over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and northwestern Carribean Sea over the next few days. Heavy rainfall is expected in southeastern Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, South Florida, Cuba, and the Florida Keys. The European model shows the system moving northeast cutting through Central Florida. The GFS model shows the system moving through between Cuba and the Florida Keys, traveling towards the Bahamas. However, the European model tends to be more historically accurate. If this storm does form (which is very likely), it will be named Alex. </p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/06/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"New Tropical System Likely to Impact Florida\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/image.png 600w, http://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/06/image.png 900w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Media Source: NHC.NOAA.gov/gtwo.php</figcaption></figure><p>Here is the full list of names for the 2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alex</li>\n<li>Bonnie</li>\n<li>Colin</li>\n<li>Danielle</li>\n<li>Earl</li>\n<li>Fiona</li>\n<li>Gaston</li>\n<li>Hermine</li>\n<li>Ian</li>\n<li>Julia</li>\n<li>Karl</li>\n<li>Lisa</li>\n<li>Martin</li>\n<li>Nicole</li>\n<li>Owen</li>\n<li>Paula</li>\n<li>Richard</li>\n<li>Shary</li>\n<li>Tobias</li>\n<li>Virginie</li>\n<li>Walter</li>\n</ul>\n",

However we do know that in a way Netflix is jealous of its competition, Disney plus one of Netflix&rsquo;s biggest rivals got into livestreaming back in February, and its been a wild success. Which is why Netflix looking into livestreaming was not surprising, because after all they are a company and need to keep up with competition in order to keep the doors open.</p>\n<p>Netflix&rsquo;s most recent earnings report shows that they are loosing subscribers at a rapid rate compared to previous years, while Disney plus managed to add 7.9 million new users during the first quarter of 2022.</p>\n<p>On top of the possibility of livestreaming, Netflix has also hinted that they will be cracking down on password sharing and will also be adding a cheaper ad-supported streaming option in attempts to possibly gain some of the lost users back.</p>",

Netflix is said to be working on livestreaming as an option for stand-up specials and other live content. Support for livestreams could open possibility's for Netflix to air live reunions, comedy specials or even a allow users to vote live for competition shows.</p>\n<p>At this current moment not much is known about this feature, as Netflix has yet to release any big statements. However we do know that in a way Netflix is jealous of its competition, Disney plus one of Netflix&rsquo;s biggest rivals got into livestreaming back in February, and its been a wild success. Which is why Netflix looking into livestreaming was not surprising, because after all they are a company and need to keep up with competition in order to keep the doors open.</p>\n<p>Netflix&rsquo;s most recent earnings report shows that they are loosing subscribers at a rapid rate compared to previous years, while Disney plus managed to add 7.9 million new users during the first quarter of 2022.</p>\n<p>On top of the possibility of livestreaming, Netflix has also hinted that they will be cracking down on password sharing and will also be adding a cheaper ad-supported streaming option in attempts to possibly gain some of the lost users back.</p>",
