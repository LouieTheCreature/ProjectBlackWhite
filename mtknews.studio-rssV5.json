The suspect was also shot in the arm, but sources say that it is not clear whether it was from the officer's shooting or not. An employee of a nearby restaurant, Eric Walsh, said that gunshots were heard around half an hour before midnight. He described how tons of people came into their restaurant with blood on their bodies, and how he was handing napkins to people to wipe the blood off, showing how gory the situation was. </p>\n<blockquote>\"People were coming off the street with blood splatters on white sneakers and skinned knees and skinned elbows... we literally just were balling up napkins and wetting them and handing them to people... it was chaos.\" -Eric Walsh, O'Neals Pub Employee. </blockquote>\n<p>There were hundreds of people on the busy street during the incident. No arrests have been made yet, but police say that two handguns and an extended magazine were found. The first suspect being tracked down is a woman in a 2018 Volkswagen Atlas (again, there are multiple suspects). Not much data has been released on the victims at the time of this article. </p>\n<p>There had been nine other separate shootings from the night before this shooting just in Philadelphia, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/philadelphia-shooting-dead\">according to Philadelphia police. </a></p>\n",

This problem has been plaguing humankind for decades but researchers at MIT, Brigham, and The Women’s Hospital have created a GEL replacement that's much easier to swallow and can be used to administer a variety of different drugs.</p>\n<p>MIT states that the gels are made from plant-based oils such as sesame oil and can be prepared with a variety of textures from a thickened beverage like a smoothie or a yogurt-like substance. These different textures allow for patients like stroke victims to take the drugs that they need in a much easier way. </p>\n<blockquote>“This platform will change our capacity for what we can do for kids, and also for adults who have difficulty receiving medication.

Cruise will be the first company to operate a commercial autonomous taxi service in a major US city, the COO of Cruise, Gil West, stated. The regulators required that the vehicles travel at a maximum speed of 30 MPH. The service will be active from 10 PM to 6 AM every day, and when weather conditions are fit for use. </p>\n<p>In April, General Motors noted that it will spend $2 billion this year on Cruise. The company has not made a profit yet but is expected to once the service is operational. Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said that he aims to reach $50 billion in revenue over the next eight years. GM is reportedly developing a car called the Origin in a partnership with Honda, which Cruise plans to use in the future. The car will have no steering wheel or gas pedal. Production for this vehicle is expected to begin in early 2023 at Factory Zero, Detriot. </p>\n<p>Elon Musk had previously promised that Tesla would be operating a robotic taxi division by 2020, which was later failed to meet. </p>\n",

Heavy rainfall is expected in southeastern Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, South Florida, Cuba, and the Florida Keys. The European model shows the system moving northeast cutting through Central Florida. The GFS model shows the system moving through between Cuba and the Florida Keys, traveling towards the Bahamas.

Double ads, dislike count not showing, bad relationship with creators, excessive trackers, and making the resolution selector harder to access are just to name a few negative changes.</p>\n<p>Huelet is an ongoing project and a platform meant to challenge monopolies like YouTube. It was founded by one of our writers, Levi Richardson, and has multiple people including Sam Thibault, our Chief Editor. Oh, and the logo was designed by yours truly, me.</p>\n<p>In a recent interview conducted by Simpli Media, Levi Richardson talked about plans he has for Huelet. A public release of Huelet is expected &quot;sometime next year&quot;. Levi believes that the fundemental reason why YouTube hasn't fixed a lot of it's issues is that they are profit driven, and they have no good reason to fix them. Huelet plans to have better tools for creators. Richardson was then asked if Huelet will use the star rating system. He thinks that it's a good idea, but seems like a mess overall. A smart idea that he stated was displaying the like to dislike ratio on the thumbnail of the video, meaning the user could see the video's rating even before clicking on it. A possible premuim version of the platform was also discussed with prices ranging from $10 - $15 per month, with additional features like theming, which will allow the user to customize the look and feel of the application or site. On the free version of Huelet, ads will be present and they could appear in the video, on the side, and right before the comments section.</p>\n<p>For the next question, Levi was asked if he would ever sell Huelet to another company. He responded by saying that he was open to the idea if the company is not profit driven, nor any huge company. He'd prefer if the aquisition worked more like an agreement among the companies, for instance how Automattic works with it's library of subsidaries such as WordPress. The last statement Levi made about Huelet on the interview was that they are fully open to collaborations, and anyone is welcome to contact them for partnerships.</p>\n<p>Here is the full interview by Simpli Media:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnhr8Yy20s</p>",
