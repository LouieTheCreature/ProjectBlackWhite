Well, they made a phone...</p>\n<img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/image-1.png\"\n\n<h5>Launch Date and Price</h5>\n<p>The design of the Nothing Phone 1 was recently revealed, and is expected to launch on July 12th, 2022, at the &quot;Return to Instinct&quot; event in London. We do not have a clear ship date or price yet, but a leak recently said that it might ship on July 21st for around $620. This indicates that it will be a mid-ranger. The company has reportedly made more than $144 million from investors and community backing.</p>\n<h5>Design and Specifications</h5>\n<p> The phone will have a translucent back, showcasing some of its internals. However, it doesn't seem as extreme as how the internals of the Nothing Ear 1 were displayed. It appears that the device will have a dual-camera setup, but the actual camera specs are unknown. The phone is expected to feature a Snapdragon 7 Series chip. One leak suggests that the phone will be capable of 45W fast charging, but the battery capacity itself is unclear.

The suspect was also shot in the arm, but sources say that it is not clear whether it was from the officer's shooting or not. An employee of a nearby restaurant, Eric Walsh, said that gunshots were heard around half an hour before midnight. He described how tons of people came into their restaurant with blood on their bodies, and how he was handing napkins to people to wipe the blood off, showing how gory the situation was. </p>\n<blockquote>\"People were coming off the street with blood splatters on white sneakers and skinned knees and skinned elbows... we literally just were balling up napkins and wetting them and handing them to people... it was chaos.\" -Eric Walsh, O'Neals Pub Employee. </blockquote>\n<p>There were hundreds of people on the busy street during the incident. No arrests have been made yet, but police say that two handguns and an extended magazine were found. The first suspect being tracked down is a woman in a 2018 Volkswagen Atlas (again, there are multiple suspects). Not much data has been released on the victims at the time of this article. </p>\n<p>There had been nine other separate shootings from the night before this shooting just in Philadelphia, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/philadelphia-shooting-dead\">according to Philadelphia police. </a></p>\n",

This problem has been plaguing humankind for decades but researchers at MIT, Brigham, and The Women’s Hospital have created a GEL replacement that's much easier to swallow and can be used to administer a variety of different drugs.</p>\n<p>MIT states that the gels are made from plant-based oils such as sesame oil and can be prepared with a variety of textures from a thickened beverage like a smoothie or a yogurt-like substance. These different textures allow for patients like stroke victims to take the drugs that they need in a much easier way. </p>\n<blockquote>“This platform will change our capacity for what we can do for kids, and also for adults who have difficulty receiving medication.

Cruise will be the first company to operate a commercial autonomous taxi service in a major US city, the COO of Cruise, Gil West, stated. The regulators required that the vehicles travel at a maximum speed of 30 MPH. The service will be active from 10 PM to 6 AM every day, and when weather conditions are fit for use. </p>\n<p>In April, General Motors noted that it will spend $2 billion this year on Cruise. The company has not made a profit yet but is expected to once the service is operational. Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said that he aims to reach $50 billion in revenue over the next eight years. GM is reportedly developing a car called the Origin in a partnership with Honda, which Cruise plans to use in the future. The car will have no steering wheel or gas pedal. Production for this vehicle is expected to begin in early 2023 at Factory Zero, Detriot. </p>\n<p>Elon Musk had previously promised that Tesla would be operating a robotic taxi division by 2020, which was later failed to meet. </p>\n",

Today marks the first day of the 2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season, running from June 1st to November 30th. <a href=\"http://mtknews.studio/noaa.gov\">NOAA</a> predicts between 14 and 21 named storms to form this season, with 6-10 becoming hurricanes, and 3-6 becoming major hurricanes (Category 3 - Category 5). </p>\n<p>Invest 91L has a 70% chance of formation in the next 48 hours, and an 80% chance of formation in the next 5 days, according to the NHC. It is expected to move northeastward over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and northwestern Carribean Sea over the next few days. Heavy rainfall is expected in southeastern Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, South Florida, Cuba, and the Florida Keys. The European model shows the system moving northeast cutting through Central Florida. The GFS model shows the system moving through between Cuba and the Florida Keys, traveling towards the Bahamas. However, the European model tends to be more historically accurate. If this storm does form (which is very likely), it will be named Alex. </p>\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/06/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"New Tropical System Likely to Impact Florida\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/image.png 600w, http://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/06/image.png 900w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Media Source: NHC.NOAA.gov/gtwo.php</figcaption></figure><p>Here is the full list of names for the 2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alex</li>\n<li>Bonnie</li>\n<li>Colin</li>\n<li>Danielle</li>\n<li>Earl</li>\n<li>Fiona</li>\n<li>Gaston</li>\n<li>Hermine</li>\n<li>Ian</li>\n<li>Julia</li>\n<li>Karl</li>\n<li>Lisa</li>\n<li>Martin</li>\n<li>Nicole</li>\n<li>Owen</li>\n<li>Paula</li>\n<li>Richard</li>\n<li>Shary</li>\n<li>Tobias</li>\n<li>Virginie</li>\n<li>Walter</li>\n</ul>\n",

An even bigger drop was seen with Nasdaq plummeting about 13% in April, facing it's worst month since October 2008. Dow Jones decreased 4.9%. Amazon (AMZN) had led this devaluation by 14.4% on Friday alone, marking it's highest single day drop since 2006.

The world's most valuable company also annouced that they hit a record breaking $19.8 Billion dollars in revenue from their subscriptions and services alone. This includes services such as Apple Music, Apple News, the App Store, Apple TV+, and more. According to a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/04/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/\" >press release by Apple</a>, the overall revenue for the March quarter topped about $97.3 Billion, or up 9% over the last year.</p>\n<figure ><img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/gettyimages-915808896.webp\"><figcaption >Apple Logo - Emmanuel Dunand / AFP / Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n<figure ><img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w1000/2022/04/tesla.webp\"><figcaption >Tesla Logo - Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Tesla (TSLA) is another tech giant that blew past it's quarterly expectations. The company had opened new factories across the U.S. and Germany recently. During Q1 2022, the car maker had produced more cars (305,407 to be exact) then expected and a huge increase over the same quarter a year ago. The share price of the brand had also risen a whopping 246.2% when compared to the first quarter of 2021.

It showed a lot of promise and even Intel decided to invest $3 millon before finally being bought by a company called GREE for $104 million in April of 2011. But here’s the thing – It didn’t have Nitro. It didn’t have any sort of subscription.</p>\n<p>Then gamers filed a class-action lawsuit against OpenFeint. Why? They claimed that it was <a href=\"https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/gamers-sue-openfeint-in-class-action-lawsuit/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" >\"compiling and misappropriating its users’ personal information, including their gender, age, education level, geographic location and household income.”</a> and “was then sold to third parties such as mobile-device application developers, advertising networks and web-analytic vendors without adequate notice or consent from consumers.” OpenFeint was shut down on December 14, 2012.</p>\n<p>This leads to the obvious question: what is Discord doing with your personal data now? <a href=\"https://libreddit.dothq.co/r/privacy/comments/eiicah/trawling_through_my_discord_data_package_after_35/\" >Here's an in-depth look from Reddit user u/cloudrac3r about Discord's personal data collection</a>. Discord says they don't sell personal data, but <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/04/553000000-reasons-not-let-facebook-make-decisions-about-your-privacy\" >similar to Facebook</a>, there's a good chance they're either lying about that or finding loopholes in the definition of \"selling.\"</p>\n<p>Now, while we're on the topic of data, what if you want to, say, just delete it all. Discord gives you the option to do that. <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/\" >It's the GDPR law.</a></p>\n<blockquote >The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data...<br>\n<br>\n- <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/article-17-right-to-be-forgotten/\" >Article 17 of the GDPR</a></blockquote><p>However, here's what happens when you delete your account:</p>\n<figure ><img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/04/image-5.png\"><figcaption >Image credit of the author || <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Litbelb\" >@Litbelb</a></figcaption></figure><p>And yet all their messages in servers and DMs STILL EXIST. The only difference? Your name is \"Deleted User [id]\"</p>\n<p>Erased accounts... aren't really erased, just hidden.</p>\n<p>Discord also has multiple records of simply.. <a href=\"https://libreddit.dothq.co/r/discordapp/comments/lkx1cn/discord_is_not_gdpr_compliant/\" >not deleting data when asked.</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"is-discord-really-the-bad-guy-here\" >Is Discord really the bad guy here?</h1>\n<p>Discord certainly isn't perfect. Just because these are the things discord is doing, doesn't mean that you should stop using it. Simply be mindful of all the data that Discord has on you, and remember that it can never really be deleted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"further-reading\" >Further reading</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://cadence.moe/blog/2020-06-06-why-you-shouldnt-trust-discord\" >Why you shouldn't trust Discord, by Cadence</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/discord/\" >*privacy not included | Discord, from The Mozilla Foundation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tosdr.org/en/service/536\" >Discord on ToS;DR:</a></p>\n",

            "description": "\n<p><em>What is the First Amendment and Why is it important?</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-i\" >The First Amendment</a> allows multiple social and political freedoms,one including the right to speak freely. This struck controversy into the limits of this freedom, after the attack on 9/11/2001, the usage of the word “bomb” is not permitted in airports, and is primarily not admired anywhere else either. No one’s arguing with that. Society further questioned this Amendment when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump\" >Former President Donald Trump</a> used the social media “Twitter” to promote Republican Propaganda, which some belief to be “instigating an insurrection.” This was the result of Trump tweeting that the 2020 election had been “stolen,” and falsely accused the Democratic Party of voter fraud. Furthermore, this led to Trump being banned off social media platforms. Since then, his platforms are able to be seen by the public months after the Insurrection on the Capitol on January 6th, 2021. American Citizens have made claims that these were a violation of governmental rights, primarily violating the 1st Amendment.</p>\n<p><em>What is censorship?</em></p>\n<p>Censorship is the notion into which “protection” comes into place. This is why the radios, televisions shows, and multiple media platforms censor curse words, people have the ability to “report” you, which could temporarily get you banned.

            "content": "\n<p><em>What is the First Amendment and Why is it important?</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-i\" >The First Amendment</a> allows multiple social and political freedoms,one including the right to speak freely. This struck controversy into the limits of this freedom, after the attack on 9/11/2001, the usage of the word “bomb” is not permitted in airports, and is primarily not admired anywhere else either. No one’s arguing with that. Society further questioned this Amendment when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump\" >Former President Donald Trump</a> used the social media “Twitter” to promote Republican Propaganda, which some belief to be “instigating an insurrection.” This was the result of Trump tweeting that the 2020 election had been “stolen,” and falsely accused the Democratic Party of voter fraud. Furthermore, this led to Trump being banned off social media platforms. Since then, his platforms are able to be seen by the public months after the Insurrection on the Capitol on January 6th, 2021. American Citizens have made claims that these were a violation of governmental rights, primarily violating the 1st Amendment.</p>\n<p><em>What is censorship?</em></p>\n<p>Censorship is the notion into which “protection” comes into place. This is why the radios, televisions shows, and multiple media platforms censor curse words, people have the ability to “report” you, which could temporarily get you banned. This protection is for children, victims of hate speech, and a safeguard to national security. The first amendment sets protections against censorship, this allows for people to spread their views amongst each other freely. Due to the multiple restrictions set, trying to prevent terrorism and unethical things.</p>\n<p><em>Testing the limits</em></p>\n<figure ><img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/03/20210112T0945-CAPITOL-HOMILIES-1012524.jpg\"><figcaption >(CNS photo/Reuters/Leah Millis)</figcaption></figure><p>In 2021, just 15 days before<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden\" > President Biden’s</a> Inauguration, Former President Donald Trump posted a tweet to go to his rally in D.C, and shortly after, Capitol Hill was stormed.

The top update is the latest.</em></p>\n<hr /><p>Update - Tuesday 4:20 PM UTC: A 40-mile military fleet is currently advancing on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. This is estimated to be the largest attack on Kyiv yet. Russian forces are targeting civilians, many believe. This caused the U.N. to launch a 'war crime' investigation against Russia. The city of Kharkiv is surrounded.</p>\n<p>Update - Monday 6:00 AM UTC: Ukrainian intelligence reports that Belarus is preparing to invade Ukraine, and could take action as soon as Monday. Multiple sources have reported this in addition to Ukrainian Intel, including a U.S. official that told the Washington Post. </p>\n<p>Update - Sunday 9:00 PM UTC (Edited¹): Multiple countries including the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, the U.K. have announced to expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, which is a network that connects banking institutions throughout the globe. This is expected to impact the Russian economy, but also may impact other European nations and exports. Western powers have also imposed more sanctions on Russia. President Vladimir Putin has put Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert. This means that if anyone gets involved with the conflict, Russia will use nuclear weapons. However, this is very unlikely to happen realistically, and is likely just used as a threat. President Zelensky has agreed to meet on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border for diplomatic negotiations on Monday, after a phone call with Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko.<em>¹</em> So far, the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv has been holding up against Russian forces. But right now, we have received news that Kyiv is now completely surrounded by Russian forces, and all entrance and exit points have been blocked. This will prevent any more citizens from further evacuating the city. Some are worrying that this indicates a larger attack on Kyiv might be launched soon. We know that at least a few hundred civilians have died so far and thousands more have been injured as a result of this invasion.</p>\n<p>Update - Saturday 3:30 AM UTC: Russia has been advancing towards the capital of Ukraine and a battle is currently underway for control. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has noted that he is the primary target of Russian forces, followed by his family, and people close to him. However, he has chosen to stay in Kyiv with Ukraine. \"This may be the last time you see me alive,\" Zelensky said on a conference call meeting with European leaders. The NATO Response Force has been activated and troops are being sent to countries near Ukraine, such as Poland, Hungary, and Romania as a measure to fight against the threat of Russian forces attacking neighboring countries after Ukraine. In spite of that, NATO cannot directly defend Ukraine, as the country isn't a member of NATO yet. If Ukraine was in NATO, any attacks in Ukraine from Russia would trigger NATO's Article 5, which states that any attack on a NATO nation would be an attack on all of NATO, and all of NATO must aide each other in warfare against the aggressor. So far, President Biden had stated that imposing severe sanctions is the best option to deal with Russia for now, as directly engaging in conflict could create a world war, and even a nuclear disaster. Vladimir Putin has stated that any attempts to get in Russia's way will be met with deadly and nuclear force. Major protests have broken out throughout Russia going against Putin and the war. In attempts to silence the protestors by the Russian government, thousands of arrests have took place.</p>\n<p>Update - Thursday 3:20 PM UTC: This morning, Russian forces took control of an Ukrainian air base near Kyiv, Ukraine. Throughout the country, air raid sirens have went off, in many places for the first time since World War II. President Zelensky of Ukraine has put martial law into effect. The G7 meeting has started where leaders will discuss appropriate responses to President Putin's actions. President Biden has announced that he will deliver remarks on the situation at 12:30 PM ET (5:30 PM UTC) today. The EU is considering removing Russia from SWIFT, which is an executor for financial transactions worldwide. Germany has just announced that it is expanding it's support for NATO's air policing mission in Romainia.

            "description": "\n<p>In Samsung's <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/events/unpacked/\" >Galaxy Unpacked</a> event of 2022, which took place on February 9th, Samsung introduced a new range of devices. These devices include the Galaxy S22 series, which is Samsung's flagship smartphone line, and the Galaxy S8 Series, which is Samsung's flagship tablet line. But one device in particular was rather quite interesting, the S22 Ultra.</p>\n<p>With the release of the Note 20 Ultra back in 2020, the Note series was discontinued, with a long progression of devices dating back to October 2011. What set the Note apart from other devices was that it generally came with the highest specs equipped with a smartphone, along with a large screen, and the infamous S-pen, which is a detachable stylus located on the side of the phone, which was intended for drawing, note-taking, and featured hand gestures that could control your camera from a distance, navigating through presentations, and playing media. After the Note 20 series was released, Samsung announced that they would no longer continue the line, but bring Note features to the S-series. We're finally starting to see that come into play.</p>\n<figure ><img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/N20U.jpg\"><figcaption >Samsung Note 20 Ultra | Media Source: Chris Velazco/Engadget</figcaption></figure><p>The S22 Ultra seems to be a 'continuation' of the Note line in just about every aspect except the name. It improved upon almost all areas in the Note 20 Ultra. They even look similar, besides the camera module.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-s-pen\" >The S-Pen</h3>\n<p>Just like any Note, the S22 Ultra comes with a stylus built into the side slot, otherwise, I wouldn't of even considered this a continuation. The S-Pen has all the features found on older models. Visually, there is a downgrade, however. The new S-Pen only comes in a matte-black finish, no matter what color phone you get, whereas previously, the color of the pen would match the color of the phone. Besides that, it is either the same or better in action. The 9 millisecond latency on the Note 20 Ultra was already barely noticeable. The new pen features a 2.8 millisecond latency, which is even faster, a 6.2 ms difference to be exact. This means that the time from when your pen touches the display to when you actually see the output on the screen is instant.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-display\" >The Display</h3>\n<p>Just like with any Samsung device, the display is stunning. The S22 Ultra comes with a huge 6.8 inch, 3,088 x 1,440, vibrant AMOLED display. This year, the screen also features LTPO 2.0 technology, which means the refresh rate of the screen is able to go from 120 hz all the way to an advertised 1 hz depending on the content you're viewing to save battery life. However, real life tests have shown that the minimum refresh rate goes down to 5 hz instead of 1 hz, which is still impressive. Previously with LTPO, the screen could only go down to 10 hz. The brightness of the screen has also been increased from 1500 nits to 1750 nits, which is useful if you plan on using your phone outdoors in the sunlight often.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-cameras\" >The Cameras</h3>\n<p>The camera set-up on the S22 Ultra is similar to the S21 Ultra. The main-rear camera being 108 megapixels with 100x zoom, a 10 MP 3x telephoto lens, a 10 MP telephoto lens, and a 12 MP ultrawide lens, all with optical image stabilization besides the ultrawide. Samsung also introduced 'Nightography' which is basically night-mode for better low-light camera performance. Video recording for the rear tops out at 8K/24fps, with a new feature called 'autoframing', which zooms in and out depending on the amount of people in the frame. The front selfie camera comes with a 40 MP lens placed on the top-center of the display inside a punch-hole cutout. Samsung arguably takes the best photos in the industry, but still falls behind Apple in the video department.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance-and-battery\" >Performance and Battery</h3>\n<p>The S22 Ultra comes with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm\" >Qualcomm</a>'s new 4nm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip. While it's a very fast chip, it also has it's own set of issues being a first generation processor. In certain regions, the smartphone ships with Samsung's own Exynos 2200. Exynos chips haven't had the best reputation against Snapdragon, but the Exynos 2200 continues to close the gap between the two. This year, Samsung had actually reduced the amount of RAM that ships with the phones. With the S21 Ultra, there were options of 12GBs and 16GBs. With the S22 Ultra, Samsung has stepped it down a notch with the base 128GB model coming with 8 GBs of RAM, and with the other storage options of 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB coming with 12GBs of RAM. In terms of battery, the device comes with a huge 5000 mAh battery, the same as last year's. In theory, with software improvements, the S22 Ultra should have a great battery life improvement. But in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yok_WszgNmA\" >real life tests</a>, the S22 fell just a few minutes short of the S21's battery life. A big step up however is raising the fast-charging speed from 25W to 45W. This enables the phone to go from 0% to 50% in just 20 minutes, and then reaching 100% in about an hour.</p>\n<figure ><img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/06788ab9e5f94761254741de40ca014be829961b-1.webp\"><figcaption >Samsung S22 Ultra in Burgundy | Media Source: Samsung</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"other\" >Other</h3>\n<p>The S22 Ultra comes in four main colors, Burgundy (a rose-goldish pink color), Phantom Black, Phantom White, and Green. The website also offers some online-exclusive colors like Graphite, Sky Blue, and Red. A notable design choice for specifically the S22 Ultra (not the S22 or S22+) is that Samsung has removed the camera bump that was present in previous models. The phone also includes the Ultrasonic fingerprint reader in the display, like always since it's debut. This year, all of the models ship with Android 12/One UI 4.1.</p>\n",
