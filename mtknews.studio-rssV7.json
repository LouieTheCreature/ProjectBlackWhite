The newest current software version is OneUI 1, or Android 9, released in 2018. The iPhone X, released the same year as the Note8, got updates for five years all the way until 2022. Apple had a huge lead in the software support game up until a few years ago, as Samsung and now Google are promising at least five years of updates on their flagship phones."

Even though support periods are longer now, battery degredation is still a massive issue. Phone batteries (and any lithium-iron battery) degrade over time, losing some of their capacity. Most phone batteries can only retain usable capacity for roughly three years, and after that there isn't much to do. You can't just pop the back off of your phone. They aren't user-replaceable anymore, which means you have to pay a lot to repair an already-aging phone."

A phone, a revolutionary internet communicator, and an iPod (basically a media player). Notice how camera wasn't mentioned. If your phone can do all of those things how you need it to, it's usable. Even if you can't access modern social media apps, that's a good thing. Only using social media on a computer reduces addiction dramatically. If you really want a camera... just buy one! Inexpensive cameras can be on par with even the best phone cameras nowadays. Frankly, an iPhone 5 could be a perfectly usable phone nowadays. It can still communicate with people, and play media. That's really all a phone should be, right? Keep your phone until there's a reason that your current phone doesn't do something it has to, such as being broken or having a bad battery."

An Apple Watch Series 7 is nearly identical to a Series 9. You just don't need to upgrade.

There are very few cases in which you have to buy a new Apple Watch or Galaxy Watch for new software features specifically. Apple Watches don't lose compatibility, too, so even a first generation Watch can pair just fine to an iPhone 15."

          "content": "Once again, battery degradation can be a factor for needing a new smartwatch. If it had short battery life to begin with, a weakened battery can make it nearly unusable if it'll die during the day. The only difference here is that it's generally not possible to replace a smartwatch battery without it either costing an arm and a leg or the watch breaking. Speaking of, it's a lot easier to damage a smartwatch than a phone. If your watch is smashed, it might be time for a new watch."

          "type": "paragraph",
          "content": "If you're feeling bored of your aging Apple Watch, you don't need a new smartwatch just yet. Something simple that can go a long way is buying a new watch band. They're not nearly as expensive as a new watch, and can make it look brand new. Any Apple Watch can use any band as long as it's a matching size. Pro tip: TJ Maxx commonly has official Apple Watch bands for around $15. They usually only have 40mm bands, though, but sometimes there are other official Apple accessories. Galaxy Watches use standard watch bands, so take your pick on Amazon. There's no limit on how long to keep any smartwatch, since they generally pair to modern phones for a while and don't have as many new features. An Apple Watch Series 4 is still a great smartwatch in 2023."

Even though new processors and cameras might seem appealing, there mostly isn't a reason to upgrade unless your phone is broken. There are some edge cases, such as needing the camera for work or something (DankPods knows this) or needing to review phones every year. Otherwise, though, keep your phone or watch until it's broken."

The value of this derivative is derived from fluctuations in the related stock's price. Seemingly, these would have been incredibly valuable. However, it was heavily regulated until 2000, when they were deregulated by the SEC. After this deregulation, coupled with the dot-com bubble burst, investment banks went haywire."

Since India took a pseudo-neutral stance in the struggle between US and Russian relations (They joined BRICS, an economic alliance, but also maintained a neutral stance with western Europe, Canada, US, and Australia). If the western world fully loses India, then BRICS will likely overtake NATO as the economic leading force (India is the 5th largest economy by GDP)."

If I were to put a reminders widget next to said Quizlet widget, I now have a multitasking experience right on the Home Screen.

Quizlet will be adding an interactive widget that allows users to view a flashcard set. Because of the large screen, it still feels like a good experience instead of a minuscule app. Paired with another interactive widget is when it starts to get amazing. If I were to put a reminders widget next to said Quizlet widget, I now have a multitasking experience right on the Home Screen. I can compare this to the windowed app feature on Samsung tablets and foldable, where you click on an icon and it opens a preset windowed feature. However, this is now built into the Home Screen and doesn’t even require you to open the app."

Developers haven't taken advantage of Apple's ActivityKit framework, which is a vital framework for not only Live Activities, but for the Dynamic Island too. If a developer does choose to support the Dynamic Island, they usually lock it behind a paywall, which is more often than not a subscription to the app's premium services. One example of a developer locking Dynamic Island support behind a subscription paywall is the app \"Carrot Weather\", which costs $19.99/yr for their premium services. Now, it is understandable that you're not just paying for Dynamic Island support (you also get the app's premium services for that tier), but to lock a functionality of iOS behind a paywall is beyond absurd. I get that apps like Carrot Weather have to make a call to an API every time it updates the Live Activity (which can be super expensive, depending on what API you're using), but other apps locking Dynamic Island functionality behind a paywall is just unjustifiable."

I still think it's useful in some ways, but now I often find myself swiping it away because sometimes it's more of a distraction than a functionality."

If your phone's battery is low and you have an iPhone with the Dynamic Island, instead of a popup, it uses the Dynamic Island, which you can either simply swipe away or hold if you want to enable LPM.

It's true: all our accounts, whether it be the non-important ones (such as those for one-time use products) or even our most important ones (like bank accounts and Google Accounts or Apple IDs) are getting less secure. While Google does have its fair share of features (some of which scared my life out of me), they're still really weak. This is getting even worse due to the fact that thieves are stealing iPhones and changing Apple ID passwords, basically locking the owner of the device out from their digital life.

Basically, this test is done by putting a mirror in an animal's habitat and observing how they react. If the animal recognizes themselves in the mirror, it means the animal has a sense of self according to the test, and, to prove it further, the one doing the experiment can try to change the animal's appearance, such as by putting a mark using dye on them on a place they can see in the mirror. Self-aware animals will try to get rid of the mark or otherwise interact with it."

Many people find it hard to accept that other beings may have similar levels of self-awareness to humans, especially with the test showing that even us humans can't recognize ourselves in a mirror until we're around 2 years old. The other major issue is that lots of animals don't primarily recognize the world by vision, such as dogs which primarily use their sense of smell."

However, I would not consider an iPad if it did not have the powerful features in iPadOS. Multitasking has never been better with Stage Manager, where I can have multiple overlapping windows."

The only ones that I could really find were photo editing apps like Photoshop and Affinity Photo. I could also find some vector apps like Illustrator and Vectornator, which really wasn't packed with a lot of features. I was excited for using all 8 cores of CPU and GPU to maybe get Blender, but nope. Davinci? At the time, nope. It was really underwhelming. Also, the experience just doesn't feel exactly like a computer. Even with Stage Manager, the thing just feels like a big phone at times."

          "content": "When you add a Magic Keyboard to an iPad Pro, it’s at the very least as heavy as a M1 MacBook Air, negating the portability of the form factor. While the floating design of the iPad Pro Magic Keyboard looks adequately suited for the wow factor, the display hangs over keyboard area inevitably leading to the lack of function keys and tiny trackpad. I’d get the Magic Keyboard with either way, the downsides doesn’t weigh too much for the upsides for me. Unlike the Smart Keyboard Folio and many other third-party keyboards, the Magic Keyboard comes with a built-in multi-touch trackpad and a USB-C port for power delivery. I find the Magic Keyboard very comfortable to use on my lap, but it can be top-heavy, depending on who you ask. The iPad does wobble back and forth when you tap the screen aggressively. Ever since I owned the Magic Keyboard, I never felt the need to touch my iPad screen. Plus, if you use an Apple Pencil, that is also not ideal for this product. The experience of the Magic Keyboard is equitably distinct on the iPad. Using Apple apps and various third party apps makes the Magic Keyboard very useful. The iPad’s Magic Keyboard strikes a perfect balance between altering the iPad’s nature, while keeping the core experience of the iPad as delicate as possible."

I strongly believe that Apple has done a great job marketing this product and this is their first and best modular and capable computing device. If you know how to use it, you’ll be able to get real work done on this device. I’ve been using this device for three years now, and with prior iPads, one decade of usage. The original iPad was one big iPod, but the iPad Pro showed Apple is willing to change — but they won’t at the expense of the customer. My relationship with iPadOS has been rocky. iPadOS 14 was a great update and successor to the awful, and horrible experience I had on iPadOS 13. iPadOS 15 and out was a regression in my opinion, stability — but iPadOS 16.2 and the beta of iPadOS 16.3 (when I wrote this) has brought some of it back. Stage Manager’s multitasking capabilities, and the App Store having great apps like Craft, Procreate, and DaVinci Resolve was made with the iPad in mind has made iPadOS a separate system from the Mac. While many don’t like this, I think iPadOS should get better at being a computer more than dual-booting macOS and calling it a day. macOS Ventura was designed with a mouse and keyboard only in mind. Mac laptops don’t have touchscreens as of yet. We need Pro apps, and app and/or gaming developers to take the iPad as a pro-grade computer seriously. The potential is there. Yes, Apple has a lot of work to do with stability but I still love the iPad more than the MacBooks that Apple sells for one reason, I prefer the iPad form factor."

With this bigger size compared to the HomePod Mini, it houses more audio features, such as an extra woofer and 5 tweeters. With all of this, the HomePod is able to sense the room it’s in with echolocation, allowing for a more spatial experience. It does this by moving lead voices or instruments into the center of the room and pushing the backup band into the walls, to make it feel like the band or singer is right in the room."

Apple also makes sure that that your data stays private property, by storing your data in a place that even Apple can’t access and read.

          "content": "Being a video junkie, the specs sucked me in; 10-bit 4:2:2 4K all the way to 60p for slo-mo shots with bitrates up to 400Mbps, extremely sharp footage straight from the camera. Not only that, this little powerhouse of a camera has the V-Log flat colour profile pre-installed, pushing the dynamic range of the sensor to its limits when it comes to colour grading in post. The IBIS in camera is also amazing, with up to 6.5 stops when using both body and lens image stabilization, making handheld and static shots a no-brainer without even requiring a tripod. Using the GH5 II for independent projects has been a wonder, with the mix of specs making it easy to shoot no matter the environment."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "content": "When it comes to stills performance, the GH5 excels as well with the 20.3 megapixel sensor making photos tack sharp. For sports photographers, the GH5 chucks out an impressive 12fps. When in burst mode with manual focus, AFC slightly reduces the speed down to 9fps, which is still impressive for a MFT camera. Speaking of autofocus, for stills it's accurate almost always, reducing the chances of blurry frames. Unfortunately I can't say the same about its autofocus performance when used for video; the camera knows when a face or object is there, but it still fails to properly land focus on the subject and does this weird pulsing effect. You can fine tune the autofocus speed and other bits in the settings but compared to the AF systems in Nikon and Canon bodies, the GH5 II is still miles behind."

        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "content": "Of course with all Micro Four Thirds cameras, low light is an issue because of the small sensor size but with focal reducers like the Viltrox EF-M2 II and the Metabones Speedbooster you can adapt fast-aperture autofocus Canon EF lenses onto the GH5 II with relative ease. Panasonic does have you covered with fast-aperture lenses like the Leica 10-25mm and 25-50mm f/1.7 which work amazing for both photo and video work. Fast native telephoto lenses are also available with the Panasonic Leica 50-200mm f/2.8-4 and the Olympus 40-15omm f/2.8 Pro; perfect for a lightweight sports setup."
        },
        {
          "type": "paragraph",
          "content": "The Panasonic GH5 II is an incredible hybrid camera, and with the GH6 now released it's now an even bigger steal as a B-camera to the GH6 or S1H, or even as your primary camera. The video codecs and bitrate options are still unmatched by other pricier full-frame cameras and I would still recommend this to anyone starting their journey in video production and photography."

But the dream Exynos team is <a href=\"https://n.news.naver.com/article/020/0003430139?lfrom=twitter\" >gearing up to launch in 2025</a>, that is coming close to Snapdragon and A-series chipsets, maybe even beating them to the punch at their own game with the dream team.

Google is returning the favor to rework the Exynos chipsets. Samsung has delayed using its own chips in their flagship devices until 2025, and it wasn’t for the reason you think. You see, Samsung knows the Snapdragon and A-series Bionic chips is years ahead of Samsung for years. Even back when the S21 series was out, Samsung tried cheating with the benchmark apps in order to make the illusion to its users that their product is actually better than it is. Which they have got caught, however. And don’t even get started with Google Tensor being behind in the in-house chipset race. Samsung and Google (as per usual) will be following Apple’s footsteps for the Exynos chipsets, being for Galaxy and Pixel phones only. Google is the master when it comes to AI, and also they’ll feature AMD level graphics."

Competition in this tech sector is better for consumers and drives it all home when it comes to innovation. Samsung has been reportedly working with Snapdragon chips for their Galaxy S23 series. These chipsets will have an edge still over the Android competitors. The Android phones using the new chips will have a much lower clock speed than the Galaxy S23 series, this will make the Galaxy S23 series much more powerful and more efficient than its Android phone counterparts."

It features the A14 bionic chip, which is the same type of performance in the iPhone 12. If you plan on just using your iPad to get schoolwork done and to maybe chat with friends, this is the best model for you. It can even handle some low-performance games such as Crossy Road and Clash Royale. However, there are two models to choose from in this category; the one-year old 9th generation iPad, or the brand new 10 generation one. The 10th generation iPad has a newer design, with no home button and a larger display. It also has a horizontal camera, which puts the camera in a place similar to the one on your Chromebook. It also comes in four colors; silver, pink, yellow, and blue. It has compatibility with the new Magic Keyboard Folio, which is a keyboard and case combination that lets you type comfortably and has a function row, which allows you to change the brightness and pause a movie. It starts at $450. However, if this new modern look isn’t something that interests you, you can opt in to the cheaper, less powerful, 9th generation iPad. It has a home button with touch ID, a smaller display, and bigger bezels (black space around the display). In spite of that, it starts at a cheaper $329 price tag. To summarize, if you just need the iPad for casual use and really only use it as a big phone, this is the best iPad for you."

This is perfect for people that plan to take their iPad everywhere they go, as it has mega performance in a mini size. It works with the new Apple Pencil, which makes this a great device for note-taking and drawing. However, the iPad Mini does not have a keyboard case, earning you have to buy a Bluetooth keyboard from another company. So if you need a lightweight powerhouse for drawing and gaming, this iPad is for you. It starts at $499 for 64GB of storage and Wi-Fi connectivity."

The Air has a 10.9 inch screen, the same as the base model iPad, however, the performance really stands out with the M1 chip. This is the same chip in the Macs, making it feel as fast and powerful as a high-end laptop at half the price. It comes with support for the newest Apple Pencil, and features a keyboard called the “Magic Keyboard,” which floats your iPad and has a great typing experience. Oh, and this is the last call for color in the iPad lineup, with silver, grey, blue, purple, and pink. All of these features start at $600, with 64 GB of storage and Wi-Fi connectivity."

It also has the best cameras in an iPad, with a TrueDepth camera in the front allowing for Face ID and Animoji, and Wide , Ultra Wide cameras, and a LiDAR sensor, which allows you to put different objects virtually inside a space. It has the same accessories as the iPad Air, with support for the new Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. You can get all of this for $799 on the 11 inch model, and $1099 for the 12.9-inch model."

They did not elaborate on this, so we don't know if it will be M2 iPad Pro exclusive or coming to more devices. The display can also now check if your Apple Pencil is 12 mm away using hover.

It also has better connectivity, with Wifi 6E on all models. This allows for faster downloads and uploads. You also get 5G everywhere, so you can access all your files anywhere you want. Oh yeah and ProRes capture on the back camera, but that really doesn't matter"

The system notifies pilots of faults on the aircraft and directs the pilots on how to resolve the issue. This system has been equipped on other aircraft families for decades, but was never implemented on the most delivered narrowbody in the world. This was part of legistlation made by congress in 2020 in wake of the two fatal 737 Max crashes caused by MCAS, or the Manuevering Characteristics Augmentation System, a few years ago. While implementing EICAS is benificial to the safety of the aircraft, it also introduces a plethroa of problems for both Boeing and pilots. The plane manufacturer would have to get a special exemption from congress if it does not wish to meet these new requirements."

Boeing has also stated that it would be safer to have one alerting system on all 737s, as commonality is imperative. Plenty of pilots also agree. For instance, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association emphasizes the importance of cockpit commonality as it allows airlines to have more pilots available to serve certain routes on slightly different sized aircraft-variants depending on the demand for the route. Short haul pilots, which is the class of pilots that would be operating narrowbodies such as the 737, may fly several planes in a single day, and having the same alerting system on each of those aircrafts makes it safer and simpler for the pilots. This case is especially stronger for airlines that have only family of jetliners in their fleet, such as Southwest and Ryanair, which both only operate 737s."

Having the largest fleet of any airline in the world, American Airlines undeniably has a far more diverse fleet than Southwest. This signifies that cockpit commonality is way less feasible for the airline. The APA testifies that Boeing needs to implement modern crew-alerting systems to prevent confusion during sophisticated system malfunctions. The lack of a such crew alerting system had argueably contributed to the two incidents in 2018 and 2019 involving the 737 Max and MCAS malfunctions."

If you don't know, nits are the measurement of the brightness emitted by one candle. Therefore, this 49mm display has the same amount of brightness as 2000 candles burning. This should be plenty for most users, like playing a sport in direct sunlight and extreme uses like running a marathon in the desert. As someone with an Apple Watch Series 7, 1000 nits is more than plenty for running on a hot day or just relaxing at home. However, it could be better. Sometimes I found myself squinting to see the finer details of that text while I'm running. My final verdict about the Ultra's display is that it's mostly overkill, but could be necessary for some."

The battery life would be the one reason this watch would appeal to me because it has the best battery life of an Apple Watch. The Verge got to test the battery life and recorded 69% (nice) battery remaining after two days and an hour of GPS usage. This is nice if you can't use a charger during long events during campouts and running full ultramarathons. But for when adventure calls for more time, there's low power mode. With low power mode, Apple advertises up to 60 hours of battery life, which is great for multi-day adventures in the wilderness. However, it still falls short compared to competitors. For example, the Garmin Epix 2 has seven day battery life, but comes at the price of $900."

It also has an L5 GPS, which is more accurate. It will draw from both sources to plot anything on a map, which allows for better results in places where it might be hard to get a signal like the metro. For most runners in the suburbs like me, you should be fine. But if you live in congested cities like New York, London, or Dubai, it may be really helpful."

      "description": "\n<p>Before the Steam Deck came out, it looked like the handheld market was dead. But now, we have the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, AYANEO NEXT, and more handhelds coming soon. In this article, I'll take a look at why the handheld market died, and the factors of its return.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-the-handheld-market-died\" >Why the handheld market died </h2>\n\n<p>The market for handheld consoles started to die when the iPhone released, but really began to crash when the iPhone 3G came out, with the iPhone SDK, more powerful internals, and casual mobile games. However, the Nintendo DS, the current most popular handheld at that time, was still riding high at this point, having struck a chord with both casual and hardcore gamers. The DS continued to do well enough, but it was clear that smartphones were taking over. </p>\n\n<p>On March 25, 2011 in North America, Nintendo released the Nintendo 3DS. This system had much more going on with it– a 3D display, step counter, 3D outer camera and 2D inner camera, and an Internet browser. These were mostly features Nintendo threw in there to compete with smartphones, but it really didn't matter. The 3DS sold 75 million units worldwide, but that's mostly because there were six models of the device. Casual gamers just played games on their phone or tablet, so the 3DS really just appealed to core fans. It was clear that the handheld market was shrinking into more of a niche. It didn't help that some big games were making their way to the iPhone– <a href=\"https://www.redmondpie.com/bioshock-for-ios-finally-available-to-download-direct-link/\" >BioShock</a>, the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/id763692274\" >PS2-era GTA's</a>, Minecraft Pocket Edition, and the smash-hit mobile games at the time like Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, Flight Control, and more. </p>\n\n<p>The 3DS continued to sell well enough during its life, but when the Nintendo Switch launched as a hybrid console, handhelds took a backseat. The Switch was a home console you could just pick up and take with you, so there was really no need for dedicated handhelds anymore. </p>\n\n<p>In 2020, when the coronavirus put us all in lockdown, the handheld market really died.

      "description": "\n<p>The Splatoon 3 Direct was jam-packed with news, updates, and a surprise at the end. Keep in mind that this is a summary, so not all information will be covered.</p>\n<p>After starting with a really simple summary of what is already in the game (you know, the \"you're a kid you're a squid\" stuff), we get some new information on the new actions: the squid surge and the squid roll. The amination and the time to do the squid surge seem to charge up. The squid roll is also a 180-degree turn, and cannot be changed. Also, they confirm that they slap some ink armor on each of these actions.</p>\n<p>New stages were revealed, such as Scorch Gorge, Eeltail Alley, Mincemeat Metalworks, and Undertow spillway. Other stages coming later into the game's release include Haggle fish Market. A pattern I noticed is that most of the new courses have elevation changes and are usually a focal point bridge that will be great to control in battles. Also, returning stages have been revealed. From Splatoon 1, with have Museum D'Alfonsno, Hammerhead bridge (and the bridge is done now), and Mahi-Mahi resort. Finally, from Splatoon 2, Inkblot Art Academy, Sturgeon Shipyard, MakoMart, and Wahoo world are returning. In total, 12 courses will come to launch with the game. However, more stages will be added throughout the updates.</p>\n<p>Weapon confirmations were also in the direct. To start, all weapons from the previous games will be available. They also recapped the stringer, exclusive to Splatoon 3. A new weapon class was also unveiled; the splatana. The one splatana shown was called the splatana wiper, which sends ink flying using the centrifugal force of the squee-g-like weapon. There is also a charged attack that sends ink farther and is a one-shot kill for opponents.</p>\n<p>New special weapons were also unveiled, such as the Tactiooler. \"You can find in-game beverages. These have a variety of effects such as momentarily increasing speed\" Nintendo says. The fridge has four beverages, so you can share the rest with your teammates. The wave breaker was also unveiled, which sends waves across the map. This will track opponents and will damage them just a little bit. You can avoid these waves with a well-timed jump. Finally, the Reefslider was unveiled. When activated, you go in a straight line super fast and then explode to splat nearby opponents. Also, specials from Splatoon 2 will be coming back: the Tenta Missles, Inkjet, Ink Storm, Ultra Stamp, and Booyah Bomb will be in the new game.</p>\n<p>Stores were also shown, starting with Ammo Knights, the weapon shop. It's been run by Sheldon for the entire trilogy, but there's a new currency to buy weapons. You can acquire Sheldon licenses in battles, by filling up a freshness meter and consistently using the same weapon. You can use 1 Sheldon license to buy one weapon of your level. However, if you have more Sheldon Licenses, you can get a weapon ahead of your level. In the clothing shops, the shopkeepers were unveiled, starting with Gnarly Eddy and Nail in the hat shop. In the shirt shop, Jel La Fleur runs Man-o'-wardrobe, and Mr. Coco, a large crab, runs Crush Station, the shoe shop. (As a little side note, Murch can still scrub slots and add them, and he's much older; now about 17.)</p>\n<p>The lobby was also shown. The testing range got an upgrade, and you can now go to the testing range while getting matched with opponents in battles. You can also see online ghosts and drop into anyone online. There is also a small screen where you can watch battle replays. You will be able to view all your previous battles, but it's not just a video. You can change viewpoints, so you can see how that person splatted you. Also, you can skip to certain parts, such as when you just got that team wipe. If you want to share it directly from the Switch, there is also a share feature where you can upload your gameplay to linked social media accounts such as Twitter and Facebook. They also added a sleek customization feature; lockers. You can find lockers of people you recently played with, as well as your locker. You will be able to place weapons, gear, or items that you have in the game. you may also be able to place stickers on the front and customize the color. You can acquire items at Hotlandis, a general store run by a frequent customer, Harmony.</p>\n<p>Customization was also shown, starting with Splashtags. \"They can be customized with a background, badge, and title,\" the direct states. You will also be able to customize what your character does when you win with emotes. Some displayed were Stuntin' and an image of an inkling dabbing. There will be catalogs announced every three months, with new exclusive gear, including Splashtag items and emotes.</p>\n<p>An entirely new game embedded into Splatoon 3 was announced; Table Turf Battle. You lay out collectible cards on a virtual map to claim turf. You can ink different shapes, such as a roller-like dynamo roller, and a salmon-shaped chum. There are also special cards, such as the Reefslider and Mr. Grizz. To start, everyone will be given a started deck.</p>\n<p>Salmon run updates were also shown. To start, there are new bosses. The Slammin' Lid creates a barrier for non-bosses (Chum, Smallfry, Cohock) and will try to slam it's lid (hence the name) on you if you go into this barrier. Another new boss, the big shot, is making its large debut. It shoots long-range projectiles, that then create waves similar to the wave breaker. Keep in mind, this is Slmon Run, so I bet there's some sort of buff... It also consistently enters and leaves that water, making you need to hit him at just the right time. There might also be a completely new wave added after the standard three in your job: King Salmonid. The only one confirmed was the Cohunza, which is HUGE and seems to try to crush you after jumping. Also, regular boss Salmonids will appear in this new wave, ut you dont need to collect them in a basket. Instead, you lob them at the King Salmonid that deals massive amounts of damage. You are also under a time limit still, so you still need to survive for a specified time. Also, there seems to be a Salmon Run Splatfest called \"Big run\". Apparantly you play Salmon Run on regular maps, although this is \"Still being researched\" the Squid Research Lab says.</p>\n<p>The story mode was also shown briefly. New stage modes are shown such as balloons and fail balloons, timed challenges, and infinite specials were shown. While the existence of Small-fry was unknown, it is shown in the story mode; he can be your... sub? Apparently, you can now use small fry to gnaw on switches, and possibly even more.</p>\n<p>There were also some smaller updates that I can't put in a category, so here is a list of the other new features:</p>\n<p>Vertical drawings in the mailbox will now be available.</p>\n<p>Selfies are now a thing, and you can put them in your locker and send to smart device.</p>\n<p>You can now recon any map, any time using the new recon guide.</p>\n<p>Splatnet 3 is confirmed, which can see your battle stats and order exclusive gear, and get exclusive wallpapers. You can also join a new ink game called Crusty Sean's Wandercrust tour.</p>\n<p>Amiibo will allow you to save a weapon/clothing combo.</p>\n<p>Splatoon 3 Amiibo's are releasing this holiday.</p>\n<p>Skipping the news!!!</p>\n<p>Post-launch, new weapons will be added, X battle and League Battle will come, and a large-scale paid DLC</p><p>Aaaand that's it! Ha! Gotchya. The new idols, Shiver, Frye, and Big Man make up the popular band Deep Cut. They will be hosting the news called Anarchy Splatcast, telling you all the fresh updates on the game, such as the current maps, new catalogs, and upcoming Splatfests. Spatfests have been revamped, now consisting of two halves. The first half is your standard 4v4 turf war. However, in the second half, there will be a tricolor turf war. the winning team will start in the middle with 4 people. The losing side will split up and be 2 players to a team. There is also an ultra signal which seems to give your team a cool weapon to claim turf.</p>\n<p>Finally, (For real this time) the Splatoon 3 Splatfest Premier will be on August 27th, 2022. this is a free-to-download software that will let you try out the game. As this is a Splatfest, there is a theme, and the theme is rock vs. paper vs. scissors! Choose your team and compete with other people that chose differently. So splat, ink, and win! Stay fresh!</p>\n",

A pattern I noticed is that most of the new courses have elevation changes and are usually a focal point bridge that will be great to control in battles. Also, returning stages have been revealed. From Splatoon 1, with have Museum D'Alfonsno, Hammerhead bridge (and the bridge is done now), and Mahi-Mahi resort. Finally, from Splatoon 2, Inkblot Art Academy, Sturgeon Shipyard, MakoMart, and Wahoo world are returning. In total, 12 courses will come to launch with the game. However, more stages will be added throughout the updates.</p>\n<p>Weapon confirmations were also in the direct. To start, all weapons from the previous games will be available. They also recapped the stringer, exclusive to Splatoon 3. A new weapon class was also unveiled; the splatana. The one splatana shown was called the splatana wiper, which sends ink flying using the centrifugal force of the squee-g-like weapon. There is also a charged attack that sends ink farther and is a one-shot kill for opponents.</p>\n<p>New special weapons were also unveiled, such as the Tactiooler. \"You can find in-game beverages. These have a variety of effects such as momentarily increasing speed\" Nintendo says. The fridge has four beverages, so you can share the rest with your teammates. The wave breaker was also unveiled, which sends waves across the map. This will track opponents and will damage them just a little bit. You can avoid these waves with a well-timed jump. Finally, the Reefslider was unveiled. When activated, you go in a straight line super fast and then explode to splat nearby opponents. Also, specials from Splatoon 2 will be coming back: the Tenta Missles, Inkjet, Ink Storm, Ultra Stamp, and Booyah Bomb will be in the new game.</p>\n<p>Stores were also shown, starting with Ammo Knights, the weapon shop. It's been run by Sheldon for the entire trilogy, but there's a new currency to buy weapons. You can acquire Sheldon licenses in battles, by filling up a freshness meter and consistently using the same weapon. You can use 1 Sheldon license to buy one weapon of your level. However, if you have more Sheldon Licenses, you can get a weapon ahead of your level. In the clothing shops, the shopkeepers were unveiled, starting with Gnarly Eddy and Nail in the hat shop. In the shirt shop, Jel La Fleur runs Man-o'-wardrobe, and Mr. Coco, a large crab, runs Crush Station, the shoe shop. (As a little side note, Murch can still scrub slots and add them, and he's much older; now about 17.)</p>\n<p>The lobby was also shown. The testing range got an upgrade, and you can now go to the testing range while getting matched with opponents in battles. You can also see online ghosts and drop into anyone online. There is also a small screen where you can watch battle replays. You will be able to view all your previous battles, but it's not just a video. You can change viewpoints, so you can see how that person splatted you. Also, you can skip to certain parts, such as when you just got that team wipe. If you want to share it directly from the Switch, there is also a share feature where you can upload your gameplay to linked social media accounts such as Twitter and Facebook. They also added a sleek customization feature; lockers. You can find lockers of people you recently played with, as well as your locker. You will be able to place weapons, gear, or items that you have in the game. you may also be able to place stickers on the front and customize the color. You can acquire items at Hotlandis, a general store run by a frequent customer, Harmony.</p>\n<p>Customization was also shown, starting with Splashtags. \"They can be customized with a background, badge, and title,\" the direct states. You will also be able to customize what your character does when you win with emotes. Some displayed were Stuntin' and an image of an inkling dabbing. There will be catalogs announced every three months, with new exclusive gear, including Splashtag items and emotes.</p>\n<p>An entirely new game embedded into Splatoon 3 was announced; Table Turf Battle. You lay out collectible cards on a virtual map to claim turf. You can ink different shapes, such as a roller-like dynamo roller, and a salmon-shaped chum. There are also special cards, such as the Reefslider and Mr. Grizz. To start, everyone will be given a started deck.</p>\n<p>Salmon run updates were also shown. To start, there are new bosses. The Slammin' Lid creates a barrier for non-bosses (Chum, Smallfry, Cohock) and will try to slam it's lid (hence the name) on you if you go into this barrier. Another new boss, the big shot, is making its large debut. It shoots long-range projectiles, that then create waves similar to the wave breaker. Keep in mind, this is Slmon Run, so I bet there's some sort of buff... It also consistently enters and leaves that water, making you need to hit him at just the right time. There might also be a completely new wave added after the standard three in your job: King Salmonid. The only one confirmed was the Cohunza, which is HUGE and seems to try to crush you after jumping. Also, regular boss Salmonids will appear in this new wave, ut you dont need to collect them in a basket. Instead, you lob them at the King Salmonid that deals massive amounts of damage. You are also under a time limit still, so you still need to survive for a specified time. Also, there seems to be a Salmon Run Splatfest called \"Big run\". Apparantly you play Salmon Run on regular maps, although this is \"Still being researched\" the Squid Research Lab says.</p>\n<p>The story mode was also shown briefly. New stage modes are shown such as balloons and fail balloons, timed challenges, and infinite specials were shown. While the existence of Small-fry was unknown, it is shown in the story mode; he can be your... sub? Apparently, you can now use small fry to gnaw on switches, and possibly even more.</p>\n<p>There were also some smaller updates that I can't put in a category, so here is a list of the other new features:</p>\n<p>Vertical drawings in the mailbox will now be available.</p>\n<p>Selfies are now a thing, and you can put them in your locker and send to smart device.</p>\n<p>You can now recon any map, any time using the new recon guide.</p>\n<p>Splatnet 3 is confirmed, which can see your battle stats and order exclusive gear, and get exclusive wallpapers. You can also join a new ink game called Crusty Sean's Wandercrust tour.</p>\n<p>Amiibo will allow you to save a weapon/clothing combo.</p>\n<p>Splatoon 3 Amiibo's are releasing this holiday.</p>\n<p>Skipping the news!!!</p>\n<p>Post-launch, new weapons will be added, X battle and League Battle will come, and a large-scale paid DLC</p><p>Aaaand that's it! Ha! Gotchya. The new idols, Shiver, Frye, and Big Man make up the popular band Deep Cut. They will be hosting the news called Anarchy Splatcast, telling you all the fresh updates on the game, such as the current maps, new catalogs, and upcoming Splatfests. Spatfests have been revamped, now consisting of two halves. The first half is your standard 4v4 turf war. However, in the second half, there will be a tricolor turf war. the winning team will start in the middle with 4 people. The losing side will split up and be 2 players to a team. There is also an ultra signal which seems to give your team a cool weapon to claim turf.</p>\n<p>Finally, (For real this time) the Splatoon 3 Splatfest Premier will be on August 27th, 2022. this is a free-to-download software that will let you try out the game. As this is a Splatfest, there is a theme, and the theme is rock vs. paper vs. scissors! Choose your team and compete with other people that chose differently. So splat, ink, and win! Stay fresh!</p>\n",

We do not have a clear ship date or price yet, but a leak recently said that it might ship on July 21st for around $620. This indicates that it will be a mid-ranger. The company has reportedly made more than $144 million from investors and community backing.</p>\n<h5>Design and Specifications</h5>\n<p> The phone will have a translucent back, showcasing some of its internals. However, it doesn't seem as extreme as how the internals of the Nothing Ear 1 were displayed. It appears that the device will have a dual-camera setup, but the actual camera specs are unknown. The phone is expected to feature a Snapdragon 7 Series chip. One leak suggests that the phone will be capable of 45W fast charging, but the battery capacity itself is unclear. And yes, it will have wireless charging capabilities. The CEO of Nothing, Carl Pei, has promised that the phone will receive four years of software updates. He has also said that NothingOS will feature seamless integration with its own and third-party products, which seems like a tough promise to make. Speaking of the OS, it is expected to have minimal animations, and graphical elements unique to Nothing. The sound design is also supposed to be unique, having &quot;raw&quot; sounds and imitating things like &quot;morse code, oscillators, and digital watches&quot;. NothingOS will be based on Google's Android.</p>\n",

The suspect was also shot in the arm, but sources say that it is not clear whether it was from the officer's shooting or not. An employee of a nearby restaurant, Eric Walsh, said that gunshots were heard around half an hour before midnight. He described how tons of people came into their restaurant with blood on their bodies, and how he was handing napkins to people to wipe the blood off, showing how gory the situation was. </p>\n<blockquote>\"People were coming off the street with blood splatters on white sneakers and skinned knees and skinned elbows... we literally just were balling up napkins and wetting them and handing them to people... it was chaos.\" -Eric Walsh, O'Neals Pub Employee. </blockquote>\n<p>There were hundreds of people on the busy street during the incident. No arrests have been made yet, but police say that two handguns and an extended magazine were found. The first suspect being tracked down is a woman in a 2018 Volkswagen Atlas (again, there are multiple suspects). Not much data has been released on the victims at the time of this article. </p>\n<p>There had been nine other separate shootings from the night before this shooting just in Philadelphia, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/philadelphia-shooting-dead\">according to Philadelphia police. </a></p>\n",

The regulators required that the vehicles travel at a maximum speed of 30 MPH. The service will be active from 10 PM to 6 AM every day, and when weather conditions are fit for use. </p>\n<p>In April, General Motors noted that it will spend $2 billion this year on Cruise. The company has not made a profit yet but is expected to once the service is operational. Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said that he aims to reach $50 billion in revenue over the next eight years. GM is reportedly developing a car called the Origin in a partnership with Honda, which Cruise plans to use in the future. The car will have no steering wheel or gas pedal. Production for this vehicle is expected to begin in early 2023 at Factory Zero, Detriot. </p>\n<p>Elon Musk had previously promised that Tesla would be operating a robotic taxi division by 2020, which was later failed to meet. </p>\n",

A public release of Huelet is expected &quot;sometime next year&quot;. Levi believes that the fundemental reason why YouTube hasn't fixed a lot of it's issues is that they are profit driven, and they have no good reason to fix them. Huelet plans to have better tools for creators. Richardson was then asked if Huelet will use the star rating system. He thinks that it's a good idea, but seems like a mess overall. A smart idea that he stated was displaying the like to dislike ratio on the thumbnail of the video, meaning the user could see the video's rating even before clicking on it. A possible premuim version of the platform was also discussed with prices ranging from $10 - $15 per month, with additional features like theming, which will allow the user to customize the look and feel of the application or site. On the free version of Huelet, ads will be present and they could appear in the video, on the side, and right before the comments section.</p>\n<p>For the next question, Levi was asked if he would ever sell Huelet to another company. He responded by saying that he was open to the idea if the company is not profit driven, nor any huge company. He'd prefer if the aquisition worked more like an agreement among the companies, for instance how Automattic works with it's library of subsidaries such as WordPress.

Though Netflix talked about heavily banning it, they decided not to, but, in 3 test countries, it will be charging for it due to the revenue that was not being demonstrated. The countries will be Peru, Chile, and Costa Rica. Many other streaming services have bought mainstream shows and movies that grow heavy competition between other companies. These services such as HBO Max, Hulu, Paramount +, Disney +, etc., are all competitors that many people are paying for being that Netflix is not the favored streaming service anymore.</p>\n<figure ><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TJXhwUY3eadLmVGVkb-D1TqwdR7vIE6DZXpPCEudWNtfqrGreag888hTywdcJph-iG25vlxdMCS-g0ht91OK8x_-gYHcuINkaSgQvuIKb_7U3ZbihXJolpjlBxmg6yH-BmE_fOco\"></figure><p><br></p>\n<p>Netflix and the Rising Prices</p>\n<p>Netflix has always claimed to have been an ad-free streaming service but due to the significant drop in revenue, they are offering to become a streaming service with ads for a cheaper price than the regular value which has also gone up. The standard plan raised to $15.50 per month which is about $1.30 more than it used to be. This made a lot of customers aggravated due to the rise in prices<br></p>\n<p>Will Netflix be Okay?</p>\n<p>Netflix is still a very successful company and brand due to its enthralling originals and rights to different shows. The ratings of Outer Banks, Ozark, Selling Sunset and Bridgerton has helped Netflix tremendously. Still, Netflix seems to be the most popular streaming service in the world with 220 million subscribers and has been around for 24 years. Due to the recent announcement of shows like Ginny and Georgia and Stranger Things, many analysts believe the ratings and stock will increase by the end of 2022 though it's unpredictable due to the fluctuating and inflating economy that the modern world is going through.</p>\n",

President Vladimir Putin has put Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert. This means that if anyone gets involved with the conflict, Russia will use nuclear weapons.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has noted that he is the primary target of Russian forces, followed by his family, and people close to him. However, he has chosen to stay in Kyiv with Ukraine. \"This may be the last time you see me alive,\" Zelensky said on a conference call meeting with European leaders. The NATO Response Force has been activated and troops are being sent to countries near Ukraine, such as Poland, Hungary, and Romania as a measure to fight against the threat of Russian forces attacking neighboring countries after Ukraine. In spite of that, NATO cannot directly defend Ukraine, as the country isn't a member of NATO yet. If Ukraine was in NATO, any attacks in Ukraine from Russia would trigger NATO's Article 5, which states that any attack on a NATO nation would be an attack on all of NATO, and all of NATO must aide each other in warfare against the aggressor. So far, President Biden had stated that imposing severe sanctions is the best option to deal with Russia for now, as directly engaging in conflict could create a world war, and even a nuclear disaster. Vladimir Putin has stated that any attempts to get in Russia's way will be met with deadly and nuclear force. Major protests have broken out throughout Russia going against Putin and the war. In attempts to silence the protestors by the Russian government, thousands of arrests have took place.</p>\n<p>Update - Thursday 3:20 PM UTC: This morning, Russian forces took control of an Ukrainian air base near Kyiv, Ukraine. Throughout the country, air raid sirens have went off, in many places for the first time since World War II. President Zelensky of Ukraine has put martial law into effect. The G7 meeting has started where leaders will discuss appropriate responses to President Putin's actions. President Biden has announced that he will deliver remarks on the situation at 12:30 PM ET (5:30 PM UTC) today. The EU is considering removing Russia from SWIFT, which is an executor for financial transactions worldwide.

      "description": "\n<p>In Samsung's <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/events/unpacked/\" >Galaxy Unpacked</a> event of 2022, which took place on February 9th, Samsung introduced a new range of devices. These devices include the Galaxy S22 series, which is Samsung's flagship smartphone line, and the Galaxy S8 Series, which is Samsung's flagship tablet line. But one device in particular was rather quite interesting, the S22 Ultra.</p>\n<p>With the release of the Note 20 Ultra back in 2020, the Note series was discontinued, with a long progression of devices dating back to October 2011. What set the Note apart from other devices was that it generally came with the highest specs equipped with a smartphone, along with a large screen, and the infamous S-pen, which is a detachable stylus located on the side of the phone, which was intended for drawing, note-taking, and featured hand gestures that could control your camera from a distance, navigating through presentations, and playing media. After the Note 20 series was released, Samsung announced that they would no longer continue the line, but bring Note features to the S-series. We're finally starting to see that come into play.</p>\n<figure ><img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/N20U.jpg\"><figcaption >Samsung Note 20 Ultra | Media Source: Chris Velazco/Engadget</figcaption></figure><p>The S22 Ultra seems to be a 'continuation' of the Note line in just about every aspect except the name. It improved upon almost all areas in the Note 20 Ultra. They even look similar, besides the camera module.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-s-pen\" >The S-Pen</h3>\n<p>Just like any Note, the S22 Ultra comes with a stylus built into the side slot, otherwise, I wouldn't of even considered this a continuation. The S-Pen has all the features found on older models. Visually, there is a downgrade, however. The new S-Pen only comes in a matte-black finish, no matter what color phone you get, whereas previously, the color of the pen would match the color of the phone. Besides that, it is either the same or better in action. The 9 millisecond latency on the Note 20 Ultra was already barely noticeable. The new pen features a 2.8 millisecond latency, which is even faster, a 6.2 ms difference to be exact. This means that the time from when your pen touches the display to when you actually see the output on the screen is instant.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-display\" >The Display</h3>\n<p>Just like with any Samsung device, the display is stunning. The S22 Ultra comes with a huge 6.8 inch, 3,088 x 1,440, vibrant AMOLED display. This year, the screen also features LTPO 2.0 technology, which means the refresh rate of the screen is able to go from 120 hz all the way to an advertised 1 hz depending on the content you're viewing to save battery life. However, real life tests have shown that the minimum refresh rate goes down to 5 hz instead of 1 hz, which is still impressive. Previously with LTPO, the screen could only go down to 10 hz. The brightness of the screen has also been increased from 1500 nits to 1750 nits, which is useful if you plan on using your phone outdoors in the sunlight often.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-cameras\" >The Cameras</h3>\n<p>The camera set-up on the S22 Ultra is similar to the S21 Ultra. The main-rear camera being 108 megapixels with 100x zoom, a 10 MP 3x telephoto lens, a 10 MP telephoto lens, and a 12 MP ultrawide lens, all with optical image stabilization besides the ultrawide. Samsung also introduced 'Nightography' which is basically night-mode for better low-light camera performance. Video recording for the rear tops out at 8K/24fps, with a new feature called 'autoframing', which zooms in and out depending on the amount of people in the frame. The front selfie camera comes with a 40 MP lens placed on the top-center of the display inside a punch-hole cutout. Samsung arguably takes the best photos in the industry, but still falls behind Apple in the video department.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance-and-battery\" >Performance and Battery</h3>\n<p>The S22 Ultra comes with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm\" >Qualcomm</a>'s new 4nm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip. While it's a very fast chip, it also has it's own set of issues being a first generation processor. In certain regions, the smartphone ships with Samsung's own Exynos 2200. Exynos chips haven't had the best reputation against Snapdragon, but the Exynos 2200 continues to close the gap between the two. This year, Samsung had actually reduced the amount of RAM that ships with the phones. With the S21 Ultra, there were options of 12GBs and 16GBs. With the S22 Ultra, Samsung has stepped it down a notch with the base 128GB model coming with 8 GBs of RAM, and with the other storage options of 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB coming with 12GBs of RAM. In terms of battery, the device comes with a huge 5000 mAh battery, the same as last year's. In theory, with software improvements, the S22 Ultra should have a great battery life improvement. But in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yok_WszgNmA\" >real life tests</a>, the S22 fell just a few minutes short of the S21's battery life. A big step up however is raising the fast-charging speed from 25W to 45W. This enables the phone to go from 0% to 50% in just 20 minutes, and then reaching 100% in about an hour.</p>\n<figure ><img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/06788ab9e5f94761254741de40ca014be829961b-1.webp\"><figcaption >Samsung S22 Ultra in Burgundy | Media Source: Samsung</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"other\" >Other</h3>\n<p>The S22 Ultra comes in four main colors, Burgundy (a rose-goldish pink color), Phantom Black, Phantom White, and Green. The website also offers some online-exclusive colors like Graphite, Sky Blue, and Red. A notable design choice for specifically the S22 Ultra (not the S22 or S22+) is that Samsung has removed the camera bump that was present in previous models. The phone also includes the Ultrasonic fingerprint reader in the display, like always since it's debut. This year, all of the models ship with Android 12/One UI 4.1.</p>\n",

But in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yok_WszgNmA\" >real life tests</a>, the S22 fell just a few minutes short of the S21's battery life. A big step up however is raising the fast-charging speed from 25W to 45W. This enables the phone to go from 0% to 50% in just 20 minutes, and then reaching 100% in about an hour.</p>\n<figure ><img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/06788ab9e5f94761254741de40ca014be829961b-1.webp\"><figcaption >Samsung S22 Ultra in Burgundy | Media Source: Samsung</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"other\" >Other</h3>\n<p>The S22 Ultra comes in four main colors, Burgundy (a rose-goldish pink color), Phantom Black, Phantom White, and Green. The website also offers some online-exclusive colors like Graphite, Sky Blue, and Red. A notable design choice for specifically the S22 Ultra (not the S22 or S22+) is that Samsung has removed the camera bump that was present in previous models. The phone also includes the Ultrasonic fingerprint reader in the display, like always since it's debut. This year, all of the models ship with Android 12/One UI 4.1.</p>\n",

      "description": "\n<p>Since the very beginnings of this nation under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States\" >U.S. Constitution</a>, presidential elections have been conducted under a very specific set of rules. The country is divided into several states. In the General Election each state, in a way, conducts their own election. Voters are prompted to choose between each nominee running for president, and they can only choose one (except in Alaska, Maine, and a few select cities in certain states, which follow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked-choice_voting_in_the_United_States\" >Ranked-Choice Voting</a>). After the polls close for the election in each state, results start coming in. In each state (besides Maine and Nebraska), the candidate with the most votes take all of that state’s electoral votes. The electoral vote count for each state is determined by their number of members in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives\" >U.S. House of Representatives</a>, plus the two members for each state in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate\" >U.S. Senate</a>. Then electors from each state meet and cast their electoral votes for whoever their state voted for, and whoever has the majority, which is currently 270, wins the presidential election.</p>\n\n<p>The Problems of Using This System</p>\n\n<p>With this system, lesser populations of smaller states actually have more power in presidential elections than bigger ones. To explain this in more detail, let’s look at two states that are inherently different, California, and Wyoming. According to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau\" >U.S. Census Bureau</a>, as of 2019, California has a population of 39.51 million. On the other hand, Wyoming, which is among the least populated states in the country, has a population of 578,759. Now, let’s look at the electoral value of each state. California has 54 electoral votes, compared to Wyoming’s 3. That means California is worth 18 times as much as Wyoming in a presidential election. That also means each electoral vote in California represents about 731,666 citizens, and one electoral vote in Wyoming represents 192,919 people. Therefore, since one electoral vote represents fewer people in Wyoming, one person has more control on who receives one electoral vote than one person does in California. California has a larger population per electoral vote, meaning one person has less control over which campaign receives an electoral vote. This is how the electoral college favors rural states.</p>\n\n<figure ><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/01/ElectoralCollege2024.svg.png\"><figcaption >2024 Presidential Election Electoral Map | Media Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure><p>That isn’t the only flaw with the electoral college. In the US, most states are either fairly liberal or fairly conservative, besides a few that lie in between. A lot of these states switch parties from election to election. These are called swing states, and they hold the most power in a presidential election because they decide which nominee gets the majority of the electoral vote. The total popular vote of these states are often split in even, causing independents or moderates to be the deciders in who their state votes for. Currently, the most competitive states are Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Virginia, Georgia, Arizona, among a few others. Now, the problem with this system is for example, if you’re a conservative living in New York, or a liberal living in Tennessee, you can already assume ahead of time that there is a pretty good chance that your state will vote for the opposing party. Because of this, you may feel unmotivated to vote, because it will make no difference. Or, if your state heavily leans towards your party, then you can also feel unmotivated to vote, because you know that your party will win regardless. Living in a swing state is better in this situation, because you have more control and power over the outcome, and you feel more motivated to vote because there’s more competition between the parties. This also makes candidates only campaign in swing states because that’s where they need more votes. A Democrat wouldn’t go campaigning in Hawaii, because that state leans heavily towards them, and to add on to that, Hawaii doesn’t carry that much electoral value, so there’s no point. And you also wouldn’t be campaigning in a state that supports heavily supports the opposite party. For example, you wouldn’t see a Republican running for president go to Massachusetts, a Democratic stronghold, because there’s no point in doing so unless you’re a Republican that supports liberal policies. If you go campaigning in a swing state, then there might be a chance that you could pick up that state.</p>\n\n<p>The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC)</p>\n\n<p>But at times, this method had been questioned. Some people wondered if this was really an accurate way to elect the most powerful person in the country. Many, particularly progressives, think that a better way to determine the winner is by popular vote, the person who has more exact votes. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) is an agreement made among multiple states to award all of their electoral votes to the candidate that wins the national popular vote. This agreement will go into effect once enough states totaling at least 270 electoral votes have joined the compact. With this in effect, whoever wins the popular vote will also win the election, even with the electoral college existing simultaneously. So far, the 15 states that have joined are Maryland, New Jersey, Illinois, Hawaii, Washington, Massachusetts, Vermont, California, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, Colorado, New Mexico, Delaware, Oregon, plus D.C. This totals 195 electoral votes, which equals about 72% of the needed 270. </p>\n\n<figure ><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/image.png\"><figcaption >Image Source: brennancenter.org, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/national-popular-vote-explained\" >'The National Popular Vote, Explained' by Alex Cohen</a></figcaption></figure><p>The Controversy</p>\n\n<p>But this system has some notable flaws. The issue is that people from all backgrounds and living situations might not be represented. More of the population tend to live in urban areas, and areas with more population density. That means with the popular vote, only the needs and desires of urban populations would be mostly considered, and citizens living in other areas might not be represented. For example, an issue that rural populations face may not be brought into light, because in the urban world, that issue may be non-existent. So the urban population, which controls the popular vote, probably won’t even consider those issues and those issues wouldn’t be voted for. However, with only one candidate winning, you can't represent every type of community, unlike in the House of Representatives. Many of the ideals that an urban area may support may contradict the ideals of a rural area. One candidate really can't support both sides of an issue, especially one that has little to no middle-ground. In these types of scenarios, the majority should be the decider, since that would impact more people. </p>\n\n<p>Only five total presidents have been elected into office while losing the popular vote in U.S. history.

Russia was the most recent ruler of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, believes that Ukraine is not an independent country, more of an attachment to Russia. Ukraine was a supposed threat to Russia’s national security which is the ultimate problem between the two. After the Soviet Union fell, Ukraine has been a toss-up for independence and created an adverse tension with Russia. The current President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been working diligently to secure the country. What and why? Russia has set up a strong military force surrounding Ukraine, this includes tanks, artillery, and missiles. Ukraine wants to join NATO and Russia believes it will ruin its power. NATO will guarantee freedom and protection, a democratic solution to problems in peace efforts. In 2004, there was an election to determine the ruling of that territory, and Ukraine candidate Viktor Yanukovych originally had won but there was alleged voter fraud, he had control in 2010 but eventually lost it fully to Russia. They have been fighting for power, Russia typically winning. There was a profuse amount of bloodshed which was lessened in 2015 with a peace agreement. Quickly after, Russia made accusations toward Ukraine stating that they violated the treaty. How is the United States involved? The US has been assisting Ukraine since 2014, supplying them with $5.4 billion to help. The Biden Administration has accused Moscow, the Capital of Russia, of sabotaging Ukraine by using an attack as an excuse for violence towards Ukraine. Ned Price, a State Department spokesman gave the gist that there would be a falsified video to insight terror. In aid to Ukraine, the US has moved troops close to Ukraine in response to the Russian military surrounding the border, Russia’s troops are more than double of US troops in Europe which is 60,000. Russia has close to 130,00 near Ukraine. The US believes that publicity of this potential plan will hopefully alter what could possibly happen and lessen the international damage between foreign relations. There is no evidence that has been presented to the public to solidify the plan Russia may act on but that does mean you shouldn’t be cautious. These videos could potentially result in real war and invasions, it is a set-up. Getty Images Economic Impacts With a potential attack, Ukraine is preparing their economy in which health professionals have been gearing up, stores are being stocked, banks have their assets secure. It is believed that preparing for something that potentially won’t happen is affecting the economy, an already poor European country. Russia has taken everything from Ukraine which is why they are so weak. Many foreign relations have frozen their accounts on Ukraine in fear of a possible battle. No telling how much further damage they can sustain. includes tanks, artillery, and missiles.

The current President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been working diligently to secure the country. What and why? Russia has set up a strong military force surrounding Ukraine, this includes tanks, artillery, and missiles. Ukraine wants to join NATO and Russia believes it will ruin its power.

This allows the minority party to entirely block a bill from even being voted on, and requires the majority party to have a 'supermajority' (60 senators) agree in order to even start the vote on a bill. The filibuster has plenty of altered versions and it has been modified, and even repealed, a few times in history. But the filibuster as we know it today started in <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/filibusters-cloture/overview.htm\" >1917, when Senators ratified Senate Rule 22</a>, that required a two-thirds majority vote to end debate in the Senate and vote on a bill. This occurred when President Woodrow Wilson wanted to declare war on Germany amidst World War I. </p>\n\n<p>In the past, Democrats have expressed multiple times about their stance against the filibuster, especially after re-gaining majority in the Senate. Republicans have blocked countless bills using the filibuster, including the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, the For the People Act, stimulus bills, and even Donald Trump’s second impeachment in the Senate. Many Democrats have called the filibuster “a threat to American democracy”, because it doesn’t allow bills to be passed, even if the bill gets the majority vote. One of the concerns to some Democrats who support the filibuster is if the Republicans gain back majority in the Senate again, then the filibuster wouldn’t really work in their favor, and it would allow them to pass numerous bills. </p>\n\n<figure ><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/01/https-_cdn.cnn.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_210224170054-sinema-manchin-split.jpg\"><figcaption >Media Source: AP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Current Democrats that support the filibuster are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin\" >Joe Manchin (D-WV)</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrsten_Sinema\" >Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ)</a>.

Such liberal changes to a beloved car among enthusiasts have sparked outrage in the community. Many critics have stated that they no longer look like a BMW, and I somewhat agree to that.
