If you don't know, nits are the measurement of the brightness emitted by one candle. Therefore, this 49mm display has the same amount of brightness as 2000 candles burning. This should be plenty for most users, like playing a sport in direct sunlight and extreme uses like running a marathon in the desert. As someone with an Apple Watch Series 7, 1000 nits is more than plenty for running on a hot day or just relaxing at home. However, it could be better. Sometimes I found myself squinting to see the finer details of that text while I'm running. My final verdict about the Ultra's display is that it's mostly overkill, but could be necessary for some."

The battery life would be the one reason this watch would appeal to me because it has the best battery life of an Apple Watch. The Verge got to test the battery life and recorded 69% (nice) battery remaining after two days and an hour of GPS usage. This is nice if you can't use a charger during long events during campouts and running full ultramarathons. But for when adventure calls for more time, there's low power mode. With low power mode, Apple advertises up to 60 hours of battery life, which is great for multi-day adventures in the wilderness. However, it still falls short compared to competitors. For example, the Garmin Epix 2 has seven day battery life, but comes at the price of $900."

It also has an L5 GPS, which is more accurate. It will draw from both sources to plot anything on a map, which allows for better results in places where it might be hard to get a signal like the metro. For most runners in the suburbs like me, you should be fine. But if you live in congested cities like New York, London, or Dubai, it may be really helpful."

She started bonding with the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and also worked on the resolution of the Suez Crisis. At the time the monarchy was also facing backlash from the press, so she worked on developing her image for the people, starting a Christmas broadcast for Britain. Also, she and Charles had two children; Andrew, born in 1960, and Edward, born in 1964. Also, Charles, their first son, was officially instigated as the Prince of Wales, being the king in the making.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"later-on\" >Later on</h3>\n\n<p>Queen Elizabeth's first milestone, her silver jubilee, was held in 1977 in honor of being on the throne for 25 years. She has as history.com says, \"a punishing schedule\" to travel, introducing Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-new-generation\" >The new generation</h3>\n\n<p>In 1981, Prince Charles found a wife, Diana Spencer. The couple had two sons, William and Harry, but the marriage quickly imploded, causing major embarrassment. In 1992, Queen Elizabeth's 40th year on the throne, she gave a speech, touching on the topic of the family \"Annus Horribilis\". Both Charles and Diana and Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah Ferguson, separated, while Princess Anne and her husband, Mark Phillips, divorced.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"yes-even-more-conflict\" >Yes, even more conflict.</h3>\n\n<p>The same year, a fire broke out at Windsor Castle, but even with the public idea of using government funds, she agreed to pay taxes on her income. A few other monarchs had done this, but it was not required by British law. In 1996, Charles and Diana divorced, but Diana was still extremely popular in public. Her death after the divorce still lead to shock and grief, even though she was no longer in the royal family. This also triggered an outraged royal family, and the public now saw the paparazzi as ill-treating people, and would never forget the death of the \"People's Princess.\"</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"modern-popularity\" >Modern popularity</h3>\n\n<p>After all the tragedies faced by the family, popularity was returning in the first decade of the 21st century. In 2002, the Queens Golden Jubilee was underway. However, with the death of her mother and sister earlier in the year, they threw the ideas out of the window. In 2005, the queen enjoyed public support when Prince Charles married Camilla Parker Bowles. In her seventh decade on the throne, there was yet ANOTHER wedding for Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011. The new Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have three children to this day; George born in 2013, Princess Charlotte born in 2015, and Prince Louis born in 2018. Later on, Prince Philip stepped down from duties in 2017, at 96. 3 years later, in 2021, he died at 99. However, we still have more celebrations. In May of 2018, Prince Harry wed Meghan Markle, a divorcee who was embraced by the royal family as a resemblance of how modern the monarchy has become. They had a son, Archie Windsor in 2019, and a daughter Lilibet Diana Windsor in 2021. Rumors also spread around that Queen Elizabeth would step away and let Prince Charles take the throne, but it was a partial transfer of power. In 2017, she dedicated some of her royal duties, such as attending the royal Remembrance Day ceremony, to the heir of the throne. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-end\" >The end</h3>\n\n<p>Until her peaceful death today, she remained a consistent monarch, and kept up with her official duties and public appearances, along with spending time with her horses and dogs.</p>\n\n<p>Long live the Queen.</p>\n",

These were mostly features Nintendo threw in there to compete with smartphones, but it really didn't matter. The 3DS sold 75 million units worldwide, but that's mostly because there were six models of the device. Casual gamers just played games on their phone or tablet, so the 3DS really just appealed to core fans. It was clear that the handheld market was shrinking into more of a niche.

In this state, your body lowers its temperature, slows its breathing, and slows your heart rate. Brain waves will also have a unique movement, and eye movement will come to a complete stop. You will also experience short bursts of activity from your brain to keep you from waking up as a result of certain forces. For example, that neighbor still has a party going on.

Apple is anticipated to unveil the iPhone 14 at an event this autumn, but The Elec reports that production for its display might begin as soon as next month.</p>\n<p>Instead of BOE, The Elec anticipates Apple to split the 30 million display purchase between its two key display manufacturers, LG and Samsung Displays. Samsung is expected to manufacture the 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays for the next iPhone 14 Pro, while LG is expected to manufacture the 6.7-inch display for the iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p>\n<p>BOE historically solely made screens for reconditioned iPhones, according to MacRumors. Apple later engaged the startup to supply OLED screens for the upcoming iPhone 12 in 2020, but the company's first batch of panels failed Apple's stringent quality control testing. A display driver chip scarcity has also hampered BOE's manufacturing since the beginning of this year.</p>\n",

      "description": "\n<p>The Splatoon 3 Direct was jam-packed with news, updates, and a surprise at the end. Keep in mind that this is a summary, so not all information will be covered.</p>\n<p>After starting with a really simple summary of what is already in the game (you know, the \"you're a kid you're a squid\" stuff), we get some new information on the new actions: the squid surge and the squid roll. The amination and the time to do the squid surge seem to charge up. The squid roll is also a 180-degree turn, and cannot be changed. Also, they confirm that they slap some ink armor on each of these actions.</p>\n<p>New stages were revealed, such as Scorch Gorge, Eeltail Alley, Mincemeat Metalworks, and Undertow spillway. Other stages coming later into the game's release include Haggle fish Market. A pattern I noticed is that most of the new courses have elevation changes and are usually a focal point bridge that will be great to control in battles. Also, returning stages have been revealed. From Splatoon 1, with have Museum D'Alfonsno, Hammerhead bridge (and the bridge is done now), and Mahi-Mahi resort. Finally, from Splatoon 2, Inkblot Art Academy, Sturgeon Shipyard, MakoMart, and Wahoo world are returning. In total, 12 courses will come to launch with the game. However, more stages will be added throughout the updates.</p>\n<p>Weapon confirmations were also in the direct. To start, all weapons from the previous games will be available. They also recapped the stringer, exclusive to Splatoon 3. A new weapon class was also unveiled; the splatana. The one splatana shown was called the splatana wiper, which sends ink flying using the centrifugal force of the squee-g-like weapon. There is also a charged attack that sends ink farther and is a one-shot kill for opponents.</p>\n<p>New special weapons were also unveiled, such as the Tactiooler. \"You can find in-game beverages. These have a variety of effects such as momentarily increasing speed\" Nintendo says. The fridge has four beverages, so you can share the rest with your teammates. The wave breaker was also unveiled, which sends waves across the map. This will track opponents and will damage them just a little bit. You can avoid these waves with a well-timed jump. Finally, the Reefslider was unveiled. When activated, you go in a straight line super fast and then explode to splat nearby opponents. Also, specials from Splatoon 2 will be coming back: the Tenta Missles, Inkjet, Ink Storm, Ultra Stamp, and Booyah Bomb will be in the new game.</p>\n<p>Stores were also shown, starting with Ammo Knights, the weapon shop. It's been run by Sheldon for the entire trilogy, but there's a new currency to buy weapons. You can acquire Sheldon licenses in battles, by filling up a freshness meter and consistently using the same weapon. You can use 1 Sheldon license to buy one weapon of your level. However, if you have more Sheldon Licenses, you can get a weapon ahead of your level. In the clothing shops, the shopkeepers were unveiled, starting with Gnarly Eddy and Nail in the hat shop. In the shirt shop, Jel La Fleur runs Man-o'-wardrobe, and Mr. Coco, a large crab, runs Crush Station, the shoe shop. (As a little side note, Murch can still scrub slots and add them, and he's much older; now about 17.)</p>\n<p>The lobby was also shown. The testing range got an upgrade, and you can now go to the testing range while getting matched with opponents in battles. You can also see online ghosts and drop into anyone online. There is also a small screen where you can watch battle replays. You will be able to view all your previous battles, but it's not just a video. You can change viewpoints, so you can see how that person splatted you. Also, you can skip to certain parts, such as when you just got that team wipe. If you want to share it directly from the Switch, there is also a share feature where you can upload your gameplay to linked social media accounts such as Twitter and Facebook. They also added a sleek customization feature; lockers. You can find lockers of people you recently played with, as well as your locker. You will be able to place weapons, gear, or items that you have in the game. you may also be able to place stickers on the front and customize the color. You can acquire items at Hotlandis, a general store run by a frequent customer, Harmony.</p>\n<p>Customization was also shown, starting with Splashtags. \"They can be customized with a background, badge, and title,\" the direct states. You will also be able to customize what your character does when you win with emotes. Some displayed were Stuntin' and an image of an inkling dabbing. There will be catalogs announced every three months, with new exclusive gear, including Splashtag items and emotes.</p>\n<p>An entirely new game embedded into Splatoon 3 was announced; Table Turf Battle. You lay out collectible cards on a virtual map to claim turf. You can ink different shapes, such as a roller-like dynamo roller, and a salmon-shaped chum. There are also special cards, such as the Reefslider and Mr. Grizz. To start, everyone will be given a started deck.</p>\n<p>Salmon run updates were also shown. To start, there are new bosses. The Slammin' Lid creates a barrier for non-bosses (Chum, Smallfry, Cohock) and will try to slam it's lid (hence the name) on you if you go into this barrier. Another new boss, the big shot, is making its large debut. It shoots long-range projectiles, that then create waves similar to the wave breaker. Keep in mind, this is Slmon Run, so I bet there's some sort of buff... It also consistently enters and leaves that water, making you need to hit him at just the right time. There might also be a completely new wave added after the standard three in your job: King Salmonid. The only one confirmed was the Cohunza, which is HUGE and seems to try to crush you after jumping. Also, regular boss Salmonids will appear in this new wave, ut you dont need to collect them in a basket. Instead, you lob them at the King Salmonid that deals massive amounts of damage. You are also under a time limit still, so you still need to survive for a specified time. Also, there seems to be a Salmon Run Splatfest called \"Big run\". Apparantly you play Salmon Run on regular maps, although this is \"Still being researched\" the Squid Research Lab says.</p>\n<p>The story mode was also shown briefly. New stage modes are shown such as balloons and fail balloons, timed challenges, and infinite specials were shown. While the existence of Small-fry was unknown, it is shown in the story mode; he can be your... sub? Apparently, you can now use small fry to gnaw on switches, and possibly even more.</p>\n<p>There were also some smaller updates that I can't put in a category, so here is a list of the other new features:</p>\n<p>Vertical drawings in the mailbox will now be available.</p>\n<p>Selfies are now a thing, and you can put them in your locker and send to smart device.</p>\n<p>You can now recon any map, any time using the new recon guide.</p>\n<p>Splatnet 3 is confirmed, which can see your battle stats and order exclusive gear, and get exclusive wallpapers. You can also join a new ink game called Crusty Sean's Wandercrust tour.</p>\n<p>Amiibo will allow you to save a weapon/clothing combo.</p>\n<p>Splatoon 3 Amiibo's are releasing this holiday.</p>\n<p>Skipping the news!!!</p>\n<p>Post-launch, new weapons will be added, X battle and League Battle will come, and a large-scale paid DLC</p><p>Aaaand that's it! Ha! Gotchya. The new idols, Shiver, Frye, and Big Man make up the popular band Deep Cut. They will be hosting the news called Anarchy Splatcast, telling you all the fresh updates on the game, such as the current maps, new catalogs, and upcoming Splatfests. Spatfests have been revamped, now consisting of two halves. The first half is your standard 4v4 turf war. However, in the second half, there will be a tricolor turf war. the winning team will start in the middle with 4 people. The losing side will split up and be 2 players to a team. There is also an ultra signal which seems to give your team a cool weapon to claim turf.</p>\n<p>Finally, (For real this time) the Splatoon 3 Splatfest Premier will be on August 27th, 2022. this is a free-to-download software that will let you try out the game.

An employee of a nearby restaurant, Eric Walsh, said that gunshots were heard around half an hour before midnight. He described how tons of people came into their restaurant with blood on their bodies, and how he was handing napkins to people to wipe the blood off, showing how gory the situation was. </p>\n<blockquote>\"People were coming off the street with blood splatters on white sneakers and skinned knees and skinned elbows... we literally just were balling up napkins and wetting them and handing them to people... it was chaos.\" -Eric Walsh, O'Neals Pub Employee. </blockquote>\n<p>There were hundreds of people on the busy street during the incident. No arrests have been made yet, but police say that two handguns and an extended magazine were found.

Cruise will be the first company to operate a commercial autonomous taxi service in a major US city, the COO of Cruise, Gil West, stated. The regulators required that the vehicles travel at a maximum speed of 30 MPH. The service will be active from 10 PM to 6 AM every day, and when weather conditions are fit for use. </p>\n<p>In April, General Motors noted that it will spend $2 billion this year on Cruise. The company has not made a profit yet but is expected to once the service is operational. Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said that he aims to reach $50 billion in revenue over the next eight years. GM is reportedly developing a car called the Origin in a partnership with Honda, which Cruise plans to use in the future. The car will have no steering wheel or gas pedal. Production for this vehicle is expected to begin in early 2023 at Factory Zero, Detriot. </p>\n<p>Elon Musk had previously promised that Tesla would be operating a robotic taxi division by 2020, which was later failed to meet. </p>\n",

But SpaceX says that they are currently still too big to take off.</p>\n<p>SpaceX says that Gen2 satellites are 22 feet long and weigh 2,755 pounds. When compared to the first generation, which only weighed 573 pounds, that is considerably smaller.</p>\n<blockquote> \"A lot of people talk a lot about how many launches per year there are to orbit, but this is not really what matters. I think what really matters is what's the total useful payload to orbit per year, Cause otherwise you could say if this were ocean ships, you'd be like comparing a dinghy to a supertanker.\" - Elon Musk</blockquote>\n<p>For SpaceX to even consider getting the satellite into space at the current weight, they would have to prepare a Starship Heavy-lift rocket, and that's no small rocket. </p>\n",

It is expected to move northeastward over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and northwestern Carribean Sea over the next few days. Heavy rainfall is expected in southeastern Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, South Florida, Cuba, and the Florida Keys. The European model shows the system moving northeast cutting through Central Florida. The GFS model shows the system moving through between Cuba and the Florida Keys, traveling towards the Bahamas. However, the European model tends to be more historically accurate.

Double ads, dislike count not showing, bad relationship with creators, excessive trackers, and making the resolution selector harder to access are just to name a few negative changes.</p>\n<p>Huelet is an ongoing project and a platform meant to challenge monopolies like YouTube. It was founded by one of our writers, Levi Richardson, and has multiple people including Sam Thibault, our Chief Editor. Oh, and the logo was designed by yours truly, me.</p>\n<p>In a recent interview conducted by Simpli Media, Levi Richardson talked about plans he has for Huelet. A public release of Huelet is expected &quot;sometime next year&quot;. Levi believes that the fundemental reason why YouTube hasn't fixed a lot of it's issues is that they are profit driven, and they have no good reason to fix them. Huelet plans to have better tools for creators. Richardson was then asked if Huelet will use the star rating system. He thinks that it's a good idea, but seems like a mess overall. A smart idea that he stated was displaying the like to dislike ratio on the thumbnail of the video, meaning the user could see the video's rating even before clicking on it. A possible premuim version of the platform was also discussed with prices ranging from $10 - $15 per month, with additional features like theming, which will allow the user to customize the look and feel of the application or site. On the free version of Huelet, ads will be present and they could appear in the video, on the side, and right before the comments section.</p>\n<p>For the next question, Levi was asked if he would ever sell Huelet to another company. He responded by saying that he was open to the idea if the company is not profit driven, nor any huge company. He'd prefer if the aquisition worked more like an agreement among the companies, for instance how Automattic works with it's library of subsidaries such as WordPress. The last statement Levi made about Huelet on the interview was that they are fully open to collaborations, and anyone is welcome to contact them for partnerships.</p>\n<p>Here is the full interview by Simpli Media:</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCnhr8Yy20s</p>",

It tells corporations to follow their guidelines... or else. Among other things, it’s the thing that forces websites to ask you if it’s OK to use cookies and trackers, and it’s the thing that forces companies to allow you to remove your online data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" >Discord</a> is a chat app valued at <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/chat-app-discord-is-worth-15-billion-after-new-funding\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" >over $15 billion</a>. Discord makes money by offering a $9.99/month subscription called “Nitro.” Right? Or is something slightly more nefarious going on behind the scenes?</p>\n<p>This article will take an in-depth look at the darker side of Discord, and what the GDPR has to do with it.</p>\n<p>Discord was founded by a gamer. His name is Jason Citron. Jason has been interested in gaming since he was very young, he says. But Discord wasn’t his first project. On February 17, 2009, Citron launched OpenFeint. Its functionality was similar to Discord. The difference? It was built directly into mobile games.

His name is Jason Citron. Jason has been interested in gaming since he was very young, he says. But Discord wasn’t his first project. On February 17, 2009, Citron launched OpenFeint.

It showed a lot of promise and even Intel decided to invest $3 millon before finally being bought by a company called GREE for $104 million in April of 2011.

The top update is the latest.</em></p>\n<hr /><p>Update - Tuesday 4:20 PM UTC: A 40-mile military fleet is currently advancing on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. This is estimated to be the largest attack on Kyiv yet. Russian forces are targeting civilians, many believe. This caused the U.N. to launch a 'war crime' investigation against Russia. The city of Kharkiv is surrounded.</p>\n<p>Update - Monday 6:00 AM UTC: Ukrainian intelligence reports that Belarus is preparing to invade Ukraine, and could take action as soon as Monday. Multiple sources have reported this in addition to Ukrainian Intel, including a U.S. official that told the Washington Post. </p>\n<p>Update - Sunday 9:00 PM UTC (Edited¹): Multiple countries including the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, the U.K. have announced to expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, which is a network that connects banking institutions throughout the globe. This is expected to impact the Russian economy, but also may impact other European nations and exports. Western powers have also imposed more sanctions on Russia. President Vladimir Putin has put Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert. This means that if anyone gets involved with the conflict, Russia will use nuclear weapons. However, this is very unlikely to happen realistically, and is likely just used as a threat. President Zelensky has agreed to meet on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border for diplomatic negotiations on Monday, after a phone call with Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko.<em>¹</em> So far, the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv has been holding up against Russian forces. But right now, we have received news that Kyiv is now completely surrounded by Russian forces, and all entrance and exit points have been blocked. This will prevent any more citizens from further evacuating the city. Some are worrying that this indicates a larger attack on Kyiv might be launched soon. We know that at least a few hundred civilians have died so far and thousands more have been injured as a result of this invasion.</p>\n<p>Update - Saturday 3:30 AM UTC: Russia has been advancing towards the capital of Ukraine and a battle is currently underway for control. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has noted that he is the primary target of Russian forces, followed by his family, and people close to him. However, he has chosen to stay in Kyiv with Ukraine. \"This may be the last time you see me alive,\" Zelensky said on a conference call meeting with European leaders. The NATO Response Force has been activated and troops are being sent to countries near Ukraine, such as Poland, Hungary, and Romania as a measure to fight against the threat of Russian forces attacking neighboring countries after Ukraine. In spite of that, NATO cannot directly defend Ukraine, as the country isn't a member of NATO yet. If Ukraine was in NATO, any attacks in Ukraine from Russia would trigger NATO's Article 5, which states that any attack on a NATO nation would be an attack on all of NATO, and all of NATO must aide each other in warfare against the aggressor. So far, President Biden had stated that imposing severe sanctions is the best option to deal with Russia for now, as directly engaging in conflict could create a world war, and even a nuclear disaster. Vladimir Putin has stated that any attempts to get in Russia's way will be met with deadly and nuclear force. Major protests have broken out throughout Russia going against Putin and the war. In attempts to silence the protestors by the Russian government, thousands of arrests have took place.</p>\n<p>Update - Thursday 3:20 PM UTC: This morning, Russian forces took control of an Ukrainian air base near Kyiv, Ukraine. Throughout the country, air raid sirens have went off, in many places for the first time since World War II. President Zelensky of Ukraine has put martial law into effect. The G7 meeting has started where leaders will discuss appropriate responses to President Putin's actions. President Biden has announced that he will deliver remarks on the situation at 12:30 PM ET (5:30 PM UTC) today. The EU is considering removing Russia from SWIFT, which is an executor for financial transactions worldwide. Germany has just announced that it is expanding it's support for NATO's air policing mission in Romainia. Multiple deaths and injuries have in reported in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Update - Thursday 6:45 AM UTC: Ukraine has begun to fight back, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LatestAnonNews/status/1496731219450818561?s=20&amp;t=lbjEABUJHd19dL4G39rfLg\" >with fighter jets of their own</a>.

What set the Note apart from other devices was that it generally came with the highest specs equipped with a smartphone, along with a large screen, and the infamous S-pen, which is a detachable stylus located on the side of the phone, which was intended for drawing, note-taking, and featured hand gestures that could control your camera from a distance, navigating through presentations, and playing media. After the Note 20 series was released, Samsung announced that they would no longer continue the line, but bring Note features to the S-series. We're finally starting to see that come into play.</p>\n<figure ><img src=\"http://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/N20U.jpg\"><figcaption >Samsung Note 20 Ultra | Media Source: Chris Velazco/Engadget</figcaption></figure><p>The S22 Ultra seems to be a 'continuation' of the Note line in just about every aspect except the name. It improved upon almost all areas in the Note 20 Ultra. They even look similar, besides the camera module.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-s-pen\" >The S-Pen</h3>\n<p>Just like any Note, the S22 Ultra comes with a stylus built into the side slot, otherwise, I wouldn't of even considered this a continuation. The S-Pen has all the features found on older models. Visually, there is a downgrade, however. The new S-Pen only comes in a matte-black finish, no matter what color phone you get, whereas previously, the color of the pen would match the color of the phone. Besides that, it is either the same or better in action. The 9 millisecond latency on the Note 20 Ultra was already barely noticeable. The new pen features a 2.8 millisecond latency, which is even faster, a 6.2 ms difference to be exact. This means that the time from when your pen touches the display to when you actually see the output on the screen is instant.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-display\" >The Display</h3>\n<p>Just like with any Samsung device, the display is stunning. The S22 Ultra comes with a huge 6.8 inch, 3,088 x 1,440, vibrant AMOLED display. This year, the screen also features LTPO 2.0 technology, which means the refresh rate of the screen is able to go from 120 hz all the way to an advertised 1 hz depending on the content you're viewing to save battery life. However, real life tests have shown that the minimum refresh rate goes down to 5 hz instead of 1 hz, which is still impressive. Previously with LTPO, the screen could only go down to 10 hz. The brightness of the screen has also been increased from 1500 nits to 1750 nits, which is useful if you plan on using your phone outdoors in the sunlight often.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-cameras\" >The Cameras</h3>\n<p>The camera set-up on the S22 Ultra is similar to the S21 Ultra. The main-rear camera being 108 megapixels with 100x zoom, a 10 MP 3x telephoto lens, a 10 MP telephoto lens, and a 12 MP ultrawide lens, all with optical image stabilization besides the ultrawide. Samsung also introduced 'Nightography' which is basically night-mode for better low-light camera performance. Video recording for the rear tops out at 8K/24fps, with a new feature called 'autoframing', which zooms in and out depending on the amount of people in the frame. The front selfie camera comes with a 40 MP lens placed on the top-center of the display inside a punch-hole cutout. Samsung arguably takes the best photos in the industry, but still falls behind Apple in the video department.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performance-and-battery\" >Performance and Battery</h3>\n<p>The S22 Ultra comes with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm\" >Qualcomm</a>'s new 4nm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip. While it's a very fast chip, it also has it's own set of issues being a first generation processor. In certain regions, the smartphone ships with Samsung's own Exynos 2200. Exynos chips haven't had the best reputation against Snapdragon, but the Exynos 2200 continues to close the gap between the two. This year, Samsung had actually reduced the amount of RAM that ships with the phones. With the S21 Ultra, there were options of 12GBs and 16GBs. With the S22 Ultra, Samsung has stepped it down a notch with the base 128GB model coming with 8 GBs of RAM, and with the other storage options of 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB coming with 12GBs of RAM. In terms of battery, the device comes with a huge 5000 mAh battery, the same as last year's. In theory, with software improvements, the S22 Ultra should have a great battery life improvement. But in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yok_WszgNmA\" >real life tests</a>, the S22 fell just a few minutes short of the S21's battery life. A big step up however is raising the fast-charging speed from 25W to 45W.

      "description": "\n<p>Since the very beginnings of this nation under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States\" >U.S. Constitution</a>, presidential elections have been conducted under a very specific set of rules. The country is divided into several states. In the General Election each state, in a way, conducts their own election. Voters are prompted to choose between each nominee running for president, and they can only choose one (except in Alaska, Maine, and a few select cities in certain states, which follow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked-choice_voting_in_the_United_States\" >Ranked-Choice Voting</a>). After the polls close for the election in each state, results start coming in. In each state (besides Maine and Nebraska), the candidate with the most votes take all of that state’s electoral votes. The electoral vote count for each state is determined by their number of members in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives\" >U.S. House of Representatives</a>, plus the two members for each state in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate\" >U.S. Senate</a>. Then electors from each state meet and cast their electoral votes for whoever their state voted for, and whoever has the majority, which is currently 270, wins the presidential election.</p>\n\n<p>The Problems of Using This System</p>\n\n<p>With this system, lesser populations of smaller states actually have more power in presidential elections than bigger ones. To explain this in more detail, let’s look at two states that are inherently different, California, and Wyoming. According to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau\" >U.S. Census Bureau</a>, as of 2019, California has a population of 39.51 million. On the other hand, Wyoming, which is among the least populated states in the country, has a population of 578,759. Now, let’s look at the electoral value of each state. California has 54 electoral votes, compared to Wyoming’s 3. That means California is worth 18 times as much as Wyoming in a presidential election. That also means each electoral vote in California represents about 731,666 citizens, and one electoral vote in Wyoming represents 192,919 people. Therefore, since one electoral vote represents fewer people in Wyoming, one person has more control on who receives one electoral vote than one person does in California. California has a larger population per electoral vote, meaning one person has less control over which campaign receives an electoral vote. This is how the electoral college favors rural states.</p>\n\n<figure ><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/01/ElectoralCollege2024.svg.png\"><figcaption >2024 Presidential Election Electoral Map | Media Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure><p>That isn’t the only flaw with the electoral college. In the US, most states are either fairly liberal or fairly conservative, besides a few that lie in between. A lot of these states switch parties from election to election. These are called swing states, and they hold the most power in a presidential election because they decide which nominee gets the majority of the electoral vote. The total popular vote of these states are often split in even, causing independents or moderates to be the deciders in who their state votes for. Currently, the most competitive states are Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Virginia, Georgia, Arizona, among a few others. Now, the problem with this system is for example, if you’re a conservative living in New York, or a liberal living in Tennessee, you can already assume ahead of time that there is a pretty good chance that your state will vote for the opposing party. Because of this, you may feel unmotivated to vote, because it will make no difference. Or, if your state heavily leans towards your party, then you can also feel unmotivated to vote, because you know that your party will win regardless. Living in a swing state is better in this situation, because you have more control and power over the outcome, and you feel more motivated to vote because there’s more competition between the parties. This also makes candidates only campaign in swing states because that’s where they need more votes. A Democrat wouldn’t go campaigning in Hawaii, because that state leans heavily towards them, and to add on to that, Hawaii doesn’t carry that much electoral value, so there’s no point. And you also wouldn’t be campaigning in a state that supports heavily supports the opposite party. For example, you wouldn’t see a Republican running for president go to Massachusetts, a Democratic stronghold, because there’s no point in doing so unless you’re a Republican that supports liberal policies. If you go campaigning in a swing state, then there might be a chance that you could pick up that state.</p>\n\n<p>The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC)</p>\n\n<p>But at times, this method had been questioned. Some people wondered if this was really an accurate way to elect the most powerful person in the country. Many, particularly progressives, think that a better way to determine the winner is by popular vote, the person who has more exact votes. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) is an agreement made among multiple states to award all of their electoral votes to the candidate that wins the national popular vote. This agreement will go into effect once enough states totaling at least 270 electoral votes have joined the compact. With this in effect, whoever wins the popular vote will also win the election, even with the electoral college existing simultaneously. So far, the 15 states that have joined are Maryland, New Jersey, Illinois, Hawaii, Washington, Massachusetts, Vermont, California, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, Colorado, New Mexico, Delaware, Oregon, plus D.C. This totals 195 electoral votes, which equals about 72% of the needed 270. </p>\n\n<figure ><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/image.png\"><figcaption >Image Source: brennancenter.org, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/national-popular-vote-explained\" >'The National Popular Vote, Explained' by Alex Cohen</a></figcaption></figure><p>The Controversy</p>\n\n<p>But this system has some notable flaws. The issue is that people from all backgrounds and living situations might not be represented. More of the population tend to live in urban areas, and areas with more population density. That means with the popular vote, only the needs and desires of urban populations would be mostly considered, and citizens living in other areas might not be represented. For example, an issue that rural populations face may not be brought into light, because in the urban world, that issue may be non-existent. So the urban population, which controls the popular vote, probably won’t even consider those issues and those issues wouldn’t be voted for. However, with only one candidate winning, you can't represent every type of community, unlike in the House of Representatives. Many of the ideals that an urban area may support may contradict the ideals of a rural area. One candidate really can't support both sides of an issue, especially one that has little to no middle-ground. In these types of scenarios, the majority should be the decider, since that would impact more people. </p>\n\n<p>Only five total presidents have been elected into office while losing the popular vote in U.S. history. In the last 134 years, only two presidents have lost the national popular vote but won the election, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush\" >George W. Bush (R)</a> in 2000, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump\" >Donald Trump (R)</a> in 2016. The last time this had happened before was when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison\" >Benjamin Harrison (R)</a> beat <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Cleveland\" >Grover Cleveland (D)</a> back in 1888, just a couple decades after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War\" >Civil War</a> and way before the party realignment.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/01/2016_large.png\"></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/01/2000_large.png\"></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/01/1888_large.png\"><figcaption> 2016, 2000, and 1888 Presidential Election Results | Media Credit: 270towin.com </figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>With midterm elections right around the corner, the victors of state legislative elections would determine the likelihood of several key states adopting the NPVIC. There are currently multiple states that have bills introduced to join the compact, but the probability of them passing in most states are low. The outcome of the midterm elections may or may not change this. </p>\n\n<p>Requested by Andre 🤍</p>\n",

Voters are prompted to choose between each nominee running for president, and they can only choose one (except in Alaska, Maine, and a few select cities in certain states, which follow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked-choice_voting_in_the_United_States\" >Ranked-Choice Voting</a>). After the polls close for the election in each state, results start coming in. In each state (besides Maine and Nebraska), the candidate with the most votes take all of that state’s electoral votes. The electoral vote count for each state is determined by their number of members in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives\" >U.S. House of Representatives</a>, plus the two members for each state in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate\" >U.S. Senate</a>. Then electors from each state meet and cast their electoral votes for whoever their state voted for, and whoever has the majority, which is currently 270, wins the presidential election.</p>\n\n<p>The Problems of Using This System</p>\n\n<p>With this system, lesser populations of smaller states actually have more power in presidential elections than bigger ones. To explain this in more detail, let’s look at two states that are inherently different, California, and Wyoming. According to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau\" >U.S. Census Bureau</a>, as of 2019, California has a population of 39.51 million. On the other hand, Wyoming, which is among the least populated states in the country, has a population of 578,759. Now, let’s look at the electoral value of each state. California has 54 electoral votes, compared to Wyoming’s 3. That means California is worth 18 times as much as Wyoming in a presidential election. That also means each electoral vote in California represents about 731,666 citizens, and one electoral vote in Wyoming represents 192,919 people. Therefore, since one electoral vote represents fewer people in Wyoming, one person has more control on who receives one electoral vote than one person does in California. California has a larger population per electoral vote, meaning one person has less control over which campaign receives an electoral vote. This is how the electoral college favors rural states.</p>\n\n<figure ><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/01/ElectoralCollege2024.svg.png\"><figcaption >2024 Presidential Election Electoral Map | Media Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure><p>That isn’t the only flaw with the electoral college. In the US, most states are either fairly liberal or fairly conservative, besides a few that lie in between. A lot of these states switch parties from election to election. These are called swing states, and they hold the most power in a presidential election because they decide which nominee gets the majority of the electoral vote. The total popular vote of these states are often split in even, causing independents or moderates to be the deciders in who their state votes for. Currently, the most competitive states are Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Virginia, Georgia, Arizona, among a few others. Now, the problem with this system is for example, if you’re a conservative living in New York, or a liberal living in Tennessee, you can already assume ahead of time that there is a pretty good chance that your state will vote for the opposing party. Because of this, you may feel unmotivated to vote, because it will make no difference. Or, if your state heavily leans towards your party, then you can also feel unmotivated to vote, because you know that your party will win regardless. Living in a swing state is better in this situation, because you have more control and power over the outcome, and you feel more motivated to vote because there’s more competition between the parties. This also makes candidates only campaign in swing states because that’s where they need more votes. A Democrat wouldn’t go campaigning in Hawaii, because that state leans heavily towards them, and to add on to that, Hawaii doesn’t carry that much electoral value, so there’s no point. And you also wouldn’t be campaigning in a state that supports heavily supports the opposite party. For example, you wouldn’t see a Republican running for president go to Massachusetts, a Democratic stronghold, because there’s no point in doing so unless you’re a Republican that supports liberal policies. If you go campaigning in a swing state, then there might be a chance that you could pick up that state.</p>\n\n<p>The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC)</p>\n\n<p>But at times, this method had been questioned. Some people wondered if this was really an accurate way to elect the most powerful person in the country. Many, particularly progressives, think that a better way to determine the winner is by popular vote, the person who has more exact votes. The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) is an agreement made among multiple states to award all of their electoral votes to the candidate that wins the national popular vote. This agreement will go into effect once enough states totaling at least 270 electoral votes have joined the compact. With this in effect, whoever wins the popular vote will also win the election, even with the electoral college existing simultaneously. So far, the 15 states that have joined are Maryland, New Jersey, Illinois, Hawaii, Washington, Massachusetts, Vermont, California, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, Colorado, New Mexico, Delaware, Oregon, plus D.C. This totals 195 electoral votes, which equals about 72% of the needed 270. </p>\n\n<figure ><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/size/w1600/2022/02/image.png\"><figcaption >Image Source: brennancenter.org, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/national-popular-vote-explained\" >'The National Popular Vote, Explained' by Alex Cohen</a></figcaption></figure><p>The Controversy</p>\n\n<p>But this system has some notable flaws. The issue is that people from all backgrounds and living situations might not be represented. More of the population tend to live in urban areas, and areas with more population density. That means with the popular vote, only the needs and desires of urban populations would be mostly considered, and citizens living in other areas might not be represented. For example, an issue that rural populations face may not be brought into light, because in the urban world, that issue may be non-existent. So the urban population, which controls the popular vote, probably won’t even consider those issues and those issues wouldn’t be voted for. However, with only one candidate winning, you can't represent every type of community, unlike in the House of Representatives. Many of the ideals that an urban area may support may contradict the ideals of a rural area. One candidate really can't support both sides of an issue, especially one that has little to no middle-ground. In these types of scenarios, the majority should be the decider, since that would impact more people. </p>\n\n<p>Only five total presidents have been elected into office while losing the popular vote in U.S. history. In the last 134 years, only two presidents have lost the national popular vote but won the election, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush\" >George W. Bush (R)</a> in 2000, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump\" >Donald Trump (R)</a> in 2016. The last time this had happened before was when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison\" >Benjamin Harrison (R)</a> beat <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Cleveland\" >Grover Cleveland (D)</a> back in 1888, just a couple decades after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War\" >Civil War</a> and way before the party realignment.</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/01/2016_large.png\"></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/01/2000_large.png\"></figure>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/01/1888_large.png\"><figcaption> 2016, 2000, and 1888 Presidential Election Results | Media Credit: 270towin.com </figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>With midterm elections right around the corner, the victors of state legislative elections would determine the likelihood of several key states adopting the NPVIC. There are currently multiple states that have bills introduced to join the compact, but the probability of them passing in most states are low. The outcome of the midterm elections may or may not change this. </p>\n\n<p>Requested by Andre 🤍</p>\n",

This allows the minority party to entirely block a bill from even being voted on, and requires the majority party to have a 'supermajority' (60 senators) agree in order to even start the vote on a bill. The filibuster has plenty of altered versions and it has been modified, and even repealed, a few times in history. But the filibuster as we know it today started in <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/filibusters-cloture/overview.htm\" >1917, when Senators ratified Senate Rule 22</a>, that required a two-thirds majority vote to end debate in the Senate and vote on a bill. This occurred when President Woodrow Wilson wanted to declare war on Germany amidst World War I. </p>\n\n<p>In the past, Democrats have expressed multiple times about their stance against the filibuster, especially after re-gaining majority in the Senate. Republicans have blocked countless bills using the filibuster, including the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, the For the People Act, stimulus bills, and even Donald Trump’s second impeachment in the Senate. Many Democrats have called the filibuster “a threat to American democracy”, because it doesn’t allow bills to be passed, even if the bill gets the majority vote. One of the concerns to some Democrats who support the filibuster is if the Republicans gain back majority in the Senate again, then the filibuster wouldn’t really work in their favor, and it would allow them to pass numerous bills. </p>\n\n<figure ><img src=\"https://mtknews.studio/content/images/2022/01/https-_cdn.cnn.com_cnnnext_dam_assets_210224170054-sinema-manchin-split.jpg\"><figcaption >Media Source: AP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Current Democrats that support the filibuster are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin\" >Joe Manchin (D-WV)</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrsten_Sinema\" >Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ)</a>.

On paper, these twins were huge improvements over their predecessors. Let’s start off with the specifications of the performance models.</p>\n\n<p>The <href=\"#aeng_bmw-bmw-m3-f80-2014-30-6mt-431-hp\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" >F80 M3</a> the performance model of the F80 Series 3, which was produced from 2014-2020. From a twin turbo I6, it produced 425 horsepower with 406 Ib-ft of torque going to the rear wheels. Paired with a 6-speed manual transmission, this can make the car go from 0-60 mph in 4.1 seconds, and ultimately reach a top speed of 155 mph. Now, let’s compare that with a new and shiny <href=\"#aeng_bmw-m3-sedan-g80-2020-30l-6mt-480-hp\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" >G80</a>. The new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M3\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" >M3</a> produces 480 horsepower, roughly a 50 hp jump, but the torque remains similar at 406 Ib-ft. Reportedly, it can do a 0-60 mph time in just 3.1 seconds, which is an insane jump from the F80’s 4.1 seconds.</p>\n\n<figure ></figure><p>Now, lets take a look at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M4\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" >M4</a>. BMW put a 450 horsepower twin turbo inline 6 in the <href=\"#aeng_bmw-bmw-m3-f80-2013-30-6mt-431-hp\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" >F82</a>. With that, the F82 reached 0-60 mph in 4.2 seconds, which a top speed of 155 mph, similar to the M3. The newer <href=\"#aeng_bmw-m4-coupe-g82-2020-30l-6mt-480-hp\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" >G82 </a>jumps the 450 to 473 horsepower with a similar I6. Just like the M3, the torque remains the same in the 2021 model. From a standing point, the G82 can reach 60 mph in just about 3.0 seconds. That’s an entire 1.2 second difference! For all models here, the torque remains the same at 406 Ib ft.</p>\n\n<p>Moving on from the performance aspect, let’s focus on the main point of this article, the design choices BMW made. BMW has a long history of their “kidney grille” design across all their lines. It’s what makes a BMW identifiable as a BMW. Throughout it’s years, the twin grilles have gotten larger, and wider as time progressed.</p>\n\n<figure ><figcaption >Then / Now / Media credits: bmwblog.com, bimmerlife.com</figcaption></figure><p>But the 2021 models include radical changes. The grilles not have only gotten bigger, but they’ve gotten taller as well. In the past, they haven’t extended too far from the bottom of the headlights. Now, the grilles of the twin models extend all the way to the bottom bumper of the chassis. Such liberal changes to a beloved car among enthusiasts have sparked outrage in the community. Many critics have stated that they no longer look like a BMW, and I somewhat agree to that. In my opinion, the new kidney grilles look very questionable.

The radiator sits right in front of the grilles.
