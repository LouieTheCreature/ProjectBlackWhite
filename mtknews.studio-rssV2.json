The company has not made a profit yet but is expected to once the service is operational. Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said that he aims to reach $50 billion in revenue over the next eight years. GM is reportedly developing a car called the Origin in a partnership with Honda, which Cruise plans to use in the future. The car will have no steering wheel or gas pedal. Production for this vehicle is expected to begin in early 2023 at Factory Zero, Detriot. </p><p>Elon Musk had previously promised that Tesla would be operating a robotic taxi division by 2020, which was later failed to meet. </p>",

Heavy rainfall is expected in southeastern Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula, Belize, South Florida, Cuba, and the Florida Keys. The European model shows the system moving northeast cutting through Central Florida. The GFS model shows the system moving through between Cuba and the Florida Keys, traveling towards the Bahamas.
